## Part 1

Automatic Transcripts: YouTube Automatic Transcripts
Manual Transcripts: Manually Transcribed

### Differences

Lecture: Programming, Data Structures and Algorithms - mod01lec49

1. Phrases are cut in the middle as the automatic ASR focuses on time rather than linguistic units.

This would be a problem if these units are given directly to MT and would lead to erroneous translations.

Note: Doesn't really lead to erroneous speech-to-text.

2. TERMS: Variable names are misrepresented, sometimes as abbreviations, etc.

#### Examples

a)
- Automatic: suppose I have ABC plus and star
- Manual: Suppose I have a, b, c, plus, and star,

b)
- Automatic: the trees a b a c
- Manual: the trees - a, b and c.

c)
- Automatic: EF + because II left child
- Manual: e f plus e left child

d)
- Automatic: you got ABC Star Plus correct
- Manual: we got a b c star plus, correct,

3. Punctuation: No punctuation marked in the automatic ASR.

4. Filler Words, Speech Errors, Repairs are a part of the transcript (Automatic)

5. The accent is often not understood by the ASR. 

#### Examples

a) 
- Automatic: Travis 
- Manual: traverse.

b)
- Automatic: or expression and Thomas
- Manual: or expression and term is

NOTE: Even though it has no concept of phrases, the automatic transcriptions are largely correct, and are usable with very minor corrections!

## Part 2

### Annotation

{ xyz }: xyz is a disfluency that was NOT originally marked in the transcript.

[ xyz ]: xyz is a disfluency that was originally marked in the transcript.

### Categories of Disfluencies

- Filler Words
- Speech Repair
	- Abandoning Train of thought
	- Repair a phrase
- Pet phrases 

NOTE: If srt file has incorrect transcription, that has been ignored. Only disfluencies spoken in the lecture have been marked.

### Numbers

**Video 1**

- Speed: Medium
- Disfluencies: 62

- Pet Phrases: "Now", "so", "like"

**Video 2**

- Speed: Medium
- Disfluencies: 81

- Pet Phrases: "So" , "okay"

**Video 3**

- Speed: Fast / Medium
- Disfluencies: 97
- Talks fast -> more disfluencies

- Pet Phrases: "right?", "ok", "you know"

**Video 4**

- Speed: Slow
- Disfluencies: 23
- Very slow -> Very less disfluencies

- Pet Phrases: "now", "getting it?"

**Video 5**

- Speed: Medium
- Disfluencies: 166
- Talks medium but LOTS of errors, speech errors, filler words, etc.

- Pet Phrases: "so", "right"

## Part 3

### Annotation Guidelines

Emphasis <emp>
- Span of Emphasis
- Louder volume than context
- Slower speed than context
- Rising tone

Pauses: Short <sp> / Long <lp>
- Pauses between speech
- <1 second is a short pause

Tone Change: Rising Tone <rt> / Falling Tone <ft>
- Change of pitch (within a word) marked

### Numbers

**Video 1**

- Emphasis:		20
- Short Pauses:	28
- Long Pauses:	0
- Rising Tone:	125
- Falling Tone:	56

**Video 2**

- Emphasis:		11
- Short Pauses:	70
- Long Pauses:	22
- Rising Tone:	175
- Falling Tone:	56

**Video 3**

- Emphasis:		65
- Short Pauses:	100
- Long Pauses:	25
- Rising Tone:	126
- Falling Tone:	59

**Video 4**

- Emphasis:		50
- Short Pauses:	187
- Long Pauses:	31
- Rising Tone:	93
- Falling Tone:	93

**Video 5**

- Emphasis:		42
- Short Pauses:	140
- Long Pauses:	8
- Rising Tone:	111
- Falling Tone:	87

### Observations

TONE:
If ends without a falling tone, it is usually followed by : and, also, whereas, then, etc. If ends with a falling tone, it is usually the end of a sentence.

Most clauses end with a rising tone (when it is not the end of a sentence)
-> Most rising tones are with a comma in the transcripts, and most falling tones are with a full stop in the transcripts.

EMPHASIS:
- Usually on terms, or the focus.
- Overlaps with rising tones

PAUSES:
- Almost always occur without violating a linguistic boundary. 
Can be used to do phrase segmentation.

### Relevance of Prosodic Features
- Pauses and Rising Tones together can predict clausal/phrasal boundaries very well.
- Pauses and Falling Tones together can predict sentence boundaries very well.
- Phrasal and Sentential boundaries can help a lot in Machine Translation, especially for longer sentences.
- Emphasis can help us predict the current focus and/or terms of that domain.
- Emphasis and Pauses can often resolve ambiguity.

- Preserving tones and pauses when converting translated text back to speech is **essential** to retain the original meaning of the sentence.
