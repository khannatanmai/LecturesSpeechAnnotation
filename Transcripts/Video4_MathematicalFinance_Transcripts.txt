00:19
In our last two sessions, we were discussing about CVP or BEP analysis.
00:29
I hope you have understood the basic concepts now relating to first about variable cost,
00:37
fixed cost, then the contribution margin, and then about the calculation of BEP.
00:45
We will just have a look at what is PV ratio, because it is a very important calculation
00:53
for any business, for any product or for any particular plan.
00:59
So, this is a relationship between the profit margin or a contribution margin as a percentage
01:08
to revenue.
01:09
So, we relate the sales price to variable cost, we get the contribution margin, and
01:19
we divide it by selling price.
01:21
So, we known as a percentage suppose your sale of 10 lakhs, what is a gross margin or
01:29
what is a contribute margin you are earning that is the PV ratio.
01:34
If sales go up from 10 lakhs to 11 lakhs, on the extra 1 lakh of sales, what is the
01:42
extra profit which you will earn that you get from PV ratio or contribution margin ratio.
01:51
Now, the calculation is done like this.
01:55
The basic formula was profit is equal to sales minus total cost, but we divide the total
02:01
cost into variable and fixed.
02:04
And the contribution margin is a comparison between revenue and variable costs.
02:11
To calculate the profit now sales minus variable cost you get contribution.
02:19
From contribution we can deduct fixed cost to know the profit.
02:24
Now, the upper part that is from sales variable cost and contribution can be converted on
02:31
per unit basis, because all these three components change as the number of units or the level
02:37
of activity changes . Now, this formula for profit is like this
02:43
now S minus V into Q is minus FC is profit, or you can use it to calculate Q that is projected
02:54
quantity or the target quantity for certain level of profit.
02:59
So, now, FC plus expected profit is in the numerator divided by S minus VC getting it?
03:09
Then we also discuss the BEP analysis, I am just keeping its uses etcetera.
03:17
We will go to formulae.
03:23
Now, for calculating BEP in unit terms, our target is to earn fixed cost.
03:33
So, fixed cost is kept in the numerator, we divide it by contribution per unit.
03:41
If you want to make a short form you can say FC upon quantity per unit, always keep in
03:47
mind that fixed cost is not per unit, fixed cost is in total.
03:52
There is no sense to have fixed cost on a unit basis; it is a total fixed cost to be
03:58
recovered from certain number of units.
04:01
So, we divide it by contribution per unit, so that we know that how many units you need
04:08
to sell to recover that much of fixed cost which is nothing but a break even.
04:14
Now, many times it is difficult to have per unit data of contribution . So, instead of
04:22
contribution per unit, we divide it by PV ratio formula.
04:26
Now, what is the formula of PV ratio it is contribution upon sales.
04:31
So, as a percentage what is our margin is our PV ratio we divide fixed cost by PV ratio
04:38
to get BEP in sales value.
04:44
Now, this is the CVP - cost volume profit graph, it is also called as breakeven chart.
04:56
Have a look at it carefully, it is very important and I think all concepts will become clear.
05:01
If you just look at it for few seconds, getting it.
05:07
So, you have got fixed cost which is a horizontal line not starting from 0, starting from certain
05:14
level about 1 lakh in this example.
05:18
Then from there itself emerges a line going up which is a total cost line, because total
05:27
cost is never 0, it is 0 at 0 units it is equal to fixed cost, and then its slowly goes
05:34
up in the proportion in which variable costs are increasing .
05:40
Then this red line is known as total sales sometimes called as TR or other the total
05:46
revenue line, it starts with 0 and it goes up at a particular point it crosses the TC
05:55
or the other total cost line.
05:58
This point is nothing but breakeven point, because at this point you are able to cover
06:06
all your costs and earn more revenue than your cost.
06:12
Every company always wants to above this level of sales.
06:16
Below this level is what is known as loss area, because now your costs are more than
06:25
sales.
06:26
Above this level, your sales are more than costs.
06:30
So, you are in the profit area.
06:33
Once you cross breakeven every extra contribution you earn is all your profit because fixed
06:41
costs are now covered . So, as the number of units increased, the profit area can go
06:47
on increasing and increasing, but the loss area is actually limited maximum loss is equal
06:54
to fixed cost at zero point, because fixed cost are the costs which we incur irrespective
07:01
of sales.
07:02
So, at zero you have incurred all your fixed costs the revenue is 0.
07:08
So, fixed cost is a maximum loss from there the loss goes on decreasing it comes to 0
07:15
at breakeven point; and above this you have got profit that is why BEP is a very interesting
07:22
and important calculation for most of the companies or for plants, because they want
07:27
to at least break even getting it.
07:31
Then we had discussed one illustration.
07:34
Now, taking from this we will take or we will discuss one more concept I hope you remember
07:43
this illustration.
07:45
Now, suppose just have a look at this illustration once again.
07:51
Their estimated sales were given as 12000 bikes at which level they had earned a profit
08:01
of 5 lakhs.
08:04
Now, based on these there is a concept called as MOS or margin of safety.
08:13
We know that company at 12000 units is above breakeven point how much above it is is nothing
08:24
but margin of safety.
08:26
So, we had calculated breakeven point to be in terms of units at 11400.
08:35
The estimated sales are 12000, that means, 12 minus 11400, 600 bikes more than breakeven
08:44
that is called as margin of safety in units.
08:48
It can also be calculated in sales terms or it can be calculated as a percentage . So,
08:55
you are able to sell 12000 units; that means, you have a margin of 600.
09:03
So, 600 upon 12000 this how MOS is is calculated as a percentage.
09:08
I will just show you the formula.
09:14
Getting it?
09:15
Margin of safety is equal to actual sales minus breakeven sales either in units you
09:22
can do or you can in rupees you can do.
09:25
Another way of showing it is MOS as a percentage sales minus BEP that is your MOS is in bracket
09:34
divided by actual sales.
09:38
Just keep in mind that do not divide it by BEP some students mistake they calculator
09:44
MOS divide it by BEP that will also give you some answer, but that is not a margin of safety
09:50
as a percentage getting it.
09:53
Now, this represents the safety available to business at current level of sales because
09:59
everybody wants to avoid losses . So, to avoid losses, you are above certain level of sales
10:06
how much you are above is the margin of safety.
10:09
Now, let us try to do one simple illustration .
10:18
So, Prabha Devi Ornaments, they have sales of 5000 units, sale price is 50, variable
10:27
cost is 30, fixed cost is 35000.
10:32
Now, compute BEP quantity amount as well as MOS as a percentage . So, do this calculation
10:43
. So, how will you proceed?
10:49
Firstly, you have to compare 50 and 30 because that is a primary profit you are earning.
10:59
What that is known as 50 minus 30, I hope you remember that is called as a contribution
11:06
per unit . So, one calculation you will do in the beginning is compute the contribution
11:13
per unit.
11:14
So, one unit you sell gives you 20 rupees.
11:19
How much you have to earn minimum, minimum you have to earn enough to cover your 35000
11:27
because that is your fixed cost.
11:29
So, 35000 upon 20 is a BEP quantity.
11:34
You can convert the quantity into amount by multiplying it by 50 or you divide this 35000
11:44
by PV ratio.
11:45
So, how much is PV ratio 50 minus 30, 20 is a contribution divided by 50, 20 by 50.
11:56
So, 40 percent is a PV ratio . Now, if you divide fixed cost by 40 percent you will get
12:07
BEP amount.
12:09
Now, having calculated quantity and amount go for calculation of MOS.
12:16
I will show you the calculations.
12:21
I hope it is clear to you 35000 divided by 20, that means, 1750 units is a breakeven
12:33
point.
12:34
You need to sell 1750 units to recover 35000.
12:41
Now, in terms of sales value you will have to first calculate PV ratio which is 20 by
12:48
50; that means, 40 percent 35000 by 40 percent gives you 87500 rupees that is BEP in terms
12:59
of rupees.
13:00
So, first two calculations we have done.
13:03
Now, next is MOS they have given a sales of 5000.
13:07
So, compute MOS percentage.
13:09
Now, 5000 is their sales level and what you require is only 1750.
13:18
So, difference between 5000 minus 1750 is their MOS, and then convert it into percentage
13:25
ok.
13:27
So, margin of safety 5000 minus 1750 divided by their current sales of which is 5000.
13:36
So, you get 65 percent.
13:41
What it means is suppose their sale of 5000 starts falling let us say by 10 percent, 20
13:47
percent, 30 percent, 40 percent, they are still not in losses.
13:50
They will have to worry because sales are dropping, but it can go up to 65 percent before
14:00
which they will not go in losses, that is why they have a margin of safety of 65 percent.
14:09
Are you getting me?
14:10
So, these were the simple illustrations.
14:13
Now, let us go to the cases which have been shared with you.
14:19
I hope you have got the printout.
14:21
If not please take the printout, you can stop this video here, take the printout and let
14:27
us try to solve those cases together ok.
14:33
So, you have been shared with five cases.
14:37
Let us go one by one.
14:40
Let us start with Ganesh . So, Ganesh limited is selling three products in brand names A,
14:49
B and C. And these are the details of their cost structures.
14:55
So, you know the direct material labour and variable overheads which is 8, 8, 9 for product
15:02
a selling price is 35, same way for B and C. The monthly fixed cost is 480000.
15:13
Now, they have given the sales volume for 2 months July and August.
15:19
So, two sales mixes of given in July it is same 20, 20 and 20000 for A, B, C. And in
15:28
August, it is something different.
15:31
Now, we have to do two things first find the monthly profits.
15:38
So, for both the months July and August, calculate the profits of the company.
15:45
And if your calculations bring out that higher profit are earned in the month of lower volume
15:53
kindly justify.
15:54
So, think over why why it is possible, is it possible, that lesser sales and more profits
16:01
. And second in part B, if sales mix of each
16:06
month is considered as two sales mixes say mix X 1 and mix X 2, compute the breakeven
16:13
point for each mix and which of the two mix do you recommend.
16:18
So, these two months are treated as two sales plans, and then we have to calculate which
16:28
plan do you recommend . Ok, I hope you are getting it.
16:33
So, now, how will you go ahead, just think over.
16:41
I think most of you know by now that the first step is calculating the contribution per unit.
16:48
We know sales price; we know the variable costs.
16:52
So, compute the contribution . Based on contribution you can also compute the PV ratio for all
16:59
the three products . Now, you know the number of units sold in the month of July .
17:06
So, contribution per number of units will give you total contribution for July and for
17:15
August separately, from that deduct the fixed costs.
17:20
Contribution minus fixed costs gives you the proper in part a we have been asked to calculate
17:27
monthly profits, so that is the first thing you do it.
17:33
And then we will discuss as to which month has more profits you can just see that in
17:40
the month of July their total sales are 20 plus 20 plus 20 means 60000.
17:47
And in the month of August their sales have slightly gone down . So, let us see which
17:53
month gives you more profits ok . So, I am trying to show it in the excel . But
18:01
you try to do it in your own note book.
18:05
These are the 3 months . Firstly, make a statement of contribution, and for PV ratio . So, please
18:14
make four columns particulars A, B, C.
18:19
We start with sale price which is 36, 55 and 58 from that deduct variable cost per unit
18:36
for each of the three products . I hope you are doing it with me . So, please write down
18:52
the elements of variable cost, which is the DM, DL and variable overheads, which gives
18:59
us variable cost per unit . So, you have got 8, 8 and 9.
19:11
So, take these figures here . Fine, you are getting it?
19:25
So, 8 plus 8 plus 9 means variable cost per unit is 25.
19:32
Selling price is 36, variable cost is 25, so contribution per unit is 11.
19:41
So, from one unit of a company is able to make contribution margin of 11.
19:51
And as a percentage it is 0.306.
19:55
So, 11 upon 36 will give you this ratio known as PV ratio .
20:05
Now, in the same manner, take the data for product B which is 14, 8 and 20, please compute
20:21
the variable costs the total variable cost contribution and PV ratio . So, how much have
20:30
you got, are you getting a contribution of 12?
20:48
Just have a look at the solution total VC is 42, 54 minus 42 means twelve rupees is
20:56
a contribution and PV ratio is 0.22 got it.
21:06
Now, do it for product C. I think I do not have to show the solution.
21:18
You can do it for C.
21:32
Are you getting contribution of 4 rupees?
21:38
And 0.06 is the PV ratio . Please keep in mind for any case involving CVP analysis of
21:52
marginal costing the starting point will be calculation of contribution per unit . Sometimes
22:02
you know for unit, if you do not know you calculate the PV ratio for that type of units
22:08
or for that line of activity, what is a margin companies able to earn, this calculation is
22:16
a starting point.
22:17
This is the first compulsory calculation.
22:22
Now, based on this let us make the calculation of monthly profits.
22:31
So, please make a profitability statement for July now.
22:39
We know the selling price; we know the number of units.
22:45
So, you can easily calculate the sales.
22:51
You know the contribution per unit also from the contribution chart.
22:57
Apply those data and calculate the profit from each of the three products that will
23:05
become the total profit for the month of July . Are you able to do it?
23:15
. So, 11 is a profit or contribution per unit
23:20
into 20000 that means, 2 lakh sorry 20yeah 220000 is a contribution . Now, there is no
23:36
point in deducting fixed cost because you do not know separately fixed cost for A, but
23:43
if you complete it for the whole company so 220 here, 440 for B, and 80000 for C that
23:58
means for a company as a whole, they are able to earn a contribution of 540000 from a sale
24:11
of 2960000.
24:14
From this deduct fixed cost of 480000, now 540 minus 480, you get a profit of 60000.
24:28
Are you getting it?
24:33
Ok, I hope you have calculated the profit for July.
24:38
Now continue the same process calculate the profitability for August.
24:46
Again you know the selling price and contribution actually you do not have to calculate the
24:55
total sales, they do not play much role.
24:58
What we really want is called total contribution and deduct it from fixed cost fixed cost is
25:05
not going to change.
