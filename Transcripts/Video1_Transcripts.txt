Hello friends, today we are looking to finish the tenth module of our course, where we are
00:33
talking about the biological effect of radiation.
00:37
You definitely have gone through the first lecture by now and actually I am having a
00:41
quite a bit of gap between the time I record to the previous lecture and this one has I
00:45
was down a bit with fever and cough and cold.
00:48
And even today also my voice is quite a bit restricted hopefully I can Skype through .
00:54
Just to have a recap of what we have done in the previous lecture ah first you are introduced
01:00
to the different units of radiation doses that we generally use like.
01:05
Just to ah associate with radioactivity, you are very early we are associate you were introduced
01:13
to the units like urieo bacral which are associate with the radioactive disintegration.
01:18
But when we are talking about the biological effects of radiation we have to look for new
01:23
units and their units like rongio red and that came into picture which are conversion
01:30
in one of the three arts of radiation or the SI versions of them gray and Sievert.
01:36
So, you are introduce to those . And also several associated factors like different
01:42
tissues respond differently to radiation accordingly we use some kind of tissue infector these
01:48
are introduced . Then you are introduced the concept of linear energy transfer, which is
01:53
actually some kind of potential or stopping power of a tissue against radiation . Or against
02:01
a as different tissues respond differently or the same tissue I can say respond differently
02:06
to different particle depending on their mass and energy level which is given measurement
02:11
above in terms of the LET . Then you have to ah you are introduce to different
02:17
sources of radiation, living being can receive radiation from infinite number of sources
02:23
like we can we are always subjected to some kind of so called background radiation which
02:28
inverse the cosmic radiations and the rays coming from the outside atmosphere . Also
02:35
there can be radiatic particle there are going interior to our body or inside our body through
02:39
the foods that you are taking . There can be particles which are going with air during
02:46
the inhalation process . And also nowadays with increase in the medical
02:52
equipments, there are significant fraction of radiation radiation being contributed by
02:58
different kind of medical instruments like where instruments like MRI which does not
03:04
require any kind of radiation dose introduces any radiation does not introduce any kind
03:09
of radiation effect . Very general or simple kind of ah technique like an x-ray ah can
03:18
impose radiation equivalent to 11 days of natural radiation.
03:24
Whereas CT scan which is again a quite common technology nowadays that just one sitting
03:29
of hit CT scan can lead to radiation exposure to your body which is equivalent to 365 days
03:35
that is one full year of natural radiation or more than 13 days of flying .
03:41
Of course, when you are flying or you are at higher altitude you are exposed to larger
03:45
amount of cosmic radiation and that is why flying also induces quite a bit of radioactive
03:53
effect.
03:54
Now, in our on our body, but this modern medical equipments which involves radiation like-x
03:59
rays or any kind of scans, they also can have significant effect and therefore, we need
04:06
to be very very careful before undergo any such kind of them .
04:11
Then we have discussed about the biological effects of radiation and the cellular effect
04:15
of radiation.
04:16
You have seen the cellular effects of radiation can be of two types, primarily one is the
04:22
indirect effect which leads to the particle radical formation as our cell primarily comprises
04:32
of cytoplasm and water is the main component of the cytoplasm.
04:37
So, the radiation generally breaks the H 2 O molecule there leading to the formation
04:42
of several very dangerous kind of ah radicals such as the peroxide the hydroxyl and also
04:51
so called the superoxides.
04:52
They all can have important effects or important detrimental effects on the cell.
05:01
And there can be direct effect also whether radiation can change the demorphidology or
05:06
the morphology of the DNA itself we shall be looking more into them in today's lecture.
05:11
Now, the terms for introduce in a last lecture itself, but let us look look a bit more into
05:18
this two terminologies that is what where the biological effects radiation may have
05:22
they are generally classified into two categories, one is stochastic, and other deterministic
05:26
or sometimes called the nonstochastic effect.
05:28
The deterministic effect generally refers to those kind of phenomenon where or which
05:35
appears only once a threshold dose of radiation is based that is if the radiation exposure
05:42
is less than the threshold, then you will not find any kind of effect or only when the
05:47
threshold is reached the effect becomes prominent .
05:51
But once you have reach the threshold increasing the dose beyond that ah keeps worsening the
05:57
effect.
05:58
So, ah the behavior can be means if we plot something like this, where effect on this
06:05
side and the dose on this side tills if this is a threshold then below this threshold you
06:10
will not find any kind of effect, but above the threshold effect keep some increasing
06:14
very very shortly . So, this is what we called the deterministic effect.
06:20
Deterministic effects generally are immediate effects or short-term effects .
06:24
Once the threshold is reached they are guaranteed to appear.
06:29
And also the threshold value actually depends upon the particular person or particular place
06:37
which is subjected to radiation because different person or in fact, the different tissues of
06:44
the same person have different values for this threshold.
06:48
And also which kind of effect is going to appear accordingly the threshold is also going
06:53
to vary . And any early effect as I have mentioned and most of the normal tissue late effects
07:00
are deterministic or non-stochastic in nature.
07:03
These are some typical values of the threshold corresponding to the deterministic effect
07:09
like ah generally the the genital organs are the most affected by the radiation.
07:15
And as you can see here when they are subjected to say the testis is subjected to a single
07:21
absorption dose of strength 3.5 to 6 Sievert as be then that is actually quite high dose
07:29
or a prolonged absorption of measuring to year then that will lead to a permanent infertility.
07:39
Ovaries even more sensitive generally the female genitalia is much more sensitive to
07:44
the male genitalia that is why the value is even smaller even 10 times smaller to this
07:51
. The lens of eye that is also very very sensitive
07:56
to this when it is subjected to a radiation dose of something like 0.5 to 2 Sievert only,
08:02
it can result to a milky of lens.
08:05
For a scatter lock function may appear with a dose of 5 Sievert or greater than 0.15 Sievert
08:11
here for prolongment radiation dose.
08:17
And bone marrow probably is the most sensitive kind of tissue or sensitive kind of part of
08:24
the body related to radiation effects with a very relatively smaller radiation dose of
08:31
only 0.5 Sievert it can lead to the blood forming deficiency.
08:37
So, and also this data are quite a bit old, but still very much valid.
08:41
These are recommendation given by the well known ICRP that is International Commission
08:45
on Radiation Protections who generally says the standard for any kind of radiation based
08:52
guidelines . Now, putting this in comparison with stochastic effect, first stochastic effect
08:59
there is no such threshold dose.
09:01
So, stochastic effect whether that will appear or not that does not depend upon the magnitude
09:06
of the radiation that the object is being subjected to.
09:11
Rather there more likely with increasing the dose.
09:16
Or I can say that the the severity of the stochastic effect does not depend upon the
09:22
intensity of the dose, but as the dose intensifies the their appearance is more likely.
09:30
So, we cannot say that for this particular dose, this kind of stochastic effect is going
09:37
to appear or not.
09:38
But of course, they are more likely . And also there is no dose; however, stochastic
09:45
effect starting to occur, they may not at all appear, but also they can appear with
09:50
quite a small dose, because generally the effect is cumulative when someone is subject
09:54
to a occur small dose for a very prolong period, then the stochastic effect can appear.
09:59
But I repeat if the strength of the dose is more, then there more likely to appear, but
10:05
the severity of the diseases severity of the effect is has no relation with the strength
10:11
of the dose.
10:13
And stochastic effect actually concerns much larger or more catastrophically effects of
10:20
radiations such as the carcinogenesis and also the gene defects or DNA nutritions leading
10:27
to hereditary effects . So, stochastic effects are long term effects, and they are also quite
10:34
difficult to spot, whereas deterministic or non-stochastic effects are immediate effects
10:38
and they appear once their threshold is breached.
10:41
Now we need to gets some idea about the human cell cycle.
10:45
Each human cell undergoes quite a few difference stages of development . The first stage of
10:53
importance is the G 1 stage like shown in the diagram they are principally four or five
10:59
stages . Once the first stage is the G 1 phase, which is the growth phase or growth phase
11:06
one during the cell growth.
11:09
And at the end of G 1 phase, it is ready to replicate the DNA then is the S phase when
11:15
the DNA replication happens.
11:18
Then because to the G 2 phase where the DNA replication is already done, so they makes
11:24
further growth and ensures that it is ready for cell division and then the most important
11:29
one the mitosis during which the cell divides into two.
11:33
And cytokinesis actually is a follow up step of mitosis sometimes called a part of the
11:37
mitosis itself . And some cells may have an intermediate G naught stage as well, where
11:45
many human body cells may exit the cell cycle remain in a resting position or some kind
11:52
of neutral position for some time into some cells may remain there for a very, very long
11:59
time and that is referred to as a G naught phase.
12:04
Now, scientist have done some experiments to understand which particular phase of this
12:11
human cell cycle is most vulnerable to radiations . And to facilitate that what they have done
12:19
they have chosen ah different cell samples and applying some kind of sophisticated techniques,
12:25
they have ensured that their cell cycles are exactly following the same timings that is
12:31
they are perfectly synchronous with each other . Once they have developed quite a few cell
12:35
colonies which are perfectly synchronous with each other then different cell colonies were
12:39
subjected to different amounts of radiation and also in different phases of their individual
12:45
cell cycles . And it has been observed that a cell is the
12:50
most vulnerable to radiation when that is going to the mitosis process or about to go
12:56
through the mitosis process . When we subjected to radiation in the other phases like G 1
13:02
phase or S phase or early part of G 2 phase, effect of radiation is quite small , but when
13:08
it is going to the mitosis then only it is most vulnerable or it is about to start the
13:13
mitosis somewhere here then also it is very much vulnerable . And there is a reason also.
13:21
Like we know that inside the cell there are different kinds of components.
13:25
Now, if radiation effects ah some of the components say if it is effects a mitochondria, the mitochondria
13:32
may get permanently damaged, but inside a cell there can be several mitochondrion and
13:37
therefore, just damaging one may not ah affect the cell performance too much, but once the
13:44
radiation effects the nucleus then the radiation is definitely going to be the very important
13:51
and the cell is going to suffer, because nucleus is a main part of the cell and that is unique
13:56
. And the nucleus is in the most vulnerable
14:01
position when it is going to the mitosis.
14:04
This is a very rough schematic representation of cell division where both mitosis and meiosis
14:11
are shown.
14:12
Meiosis is a one during which the chromosomal exchanges happens, but ah that is not of our
14:18
interest.
14:19
Let us focus on mitosis only.
14:21
There are principally four different phases, prophase, metaphase, anaphase and telophase,
14:25
and sometimes also fifth follow phases cytokinesis which is more like a post processing phase.
14:31
During the prophase phase the chromosomes are duplicated this is where the chromosomes
14:36
are duplicated.
14:38
So, initially if there are if there are n pairs of chromosomes like it this is a parent
14:48
cell where there are in this diagram, there are four chromosomes.
14:51
The chromosomes are initially duplicated in the prophase phase leading to four chromosomes
14:57
. And now our four pairs of chromosomes I should say.
15:02
And then this chromosomes align each other along the metaphase plane during the metaphase
15:08
process, and then they subsequently separate out to develop to new daughter cells during
15:15
the anaphase getting completed during the telophase process.
15:18
Accordingly we get two different daughter cells which are identical to the parent cell.
15:23
Mitosis is the most common type of cell division that we can see and that is the one that is
15:29
responsible for development of our body from a single cell embryo to a fully grown human
15:37
person human body.
15:39
So, if mitosis is affected by radiation then there can be real catastrophe effect and something
15:49
known as cell killing.
15:51
Cell killing refers to reproductive date of a certain fraction of cell colonies when subjected
15:56
to acute radiation.
15:58
Like when a cell is affected by radiation, then ah the cell may loses reproductive power,
16:06
and accordingly it is terminology wise it is called the cell is being killed that is
16:11
cell killing or causing the reproductive death that depends and upon the level of the dose.
16:17
Again experiments are conducted with different cell colonies being subjecting them to different
16:23
levels of radiation, and then observing what fraction of that has suffered this cell killing.
16:29
And it has been found to be proportional to the LET again.
16:32
Like in case of high LET radiation it is a very, very short decline.
16:37
You can see it is a vertical straight line which is going down very very rapidly.
16:43
Here one thing of importance here is a vertical scale is a logarithmic scale and so the change
16:48
is extremely rapid . Whereas for low LET radiation, the change is very small particular in this
16:54
part, there is very little change, it is increasing only later on . So, for a high LET radiation
17:02
dose, the effect of for radiation causing the cell killing is very, very prominent.
17:12
And now this cell killing can be of five different types which are shown here.
17:19
ah (Refer Time: 17:21) subjective radiation can follow different kinds of roots all accessories
17:24
several kinds of enzymes and chemical processes.
17:28
One thing you have to remember here is that the while we are talking about the effect
17:34
of radiation on cell killing, actually all the effects are more or less chemically in
17:38
nature particular the indirect effect of radiation . Because a cell compresses a several kinds
17:44
of chemicals and as we have already seen the indirect effect of radiation is to develop
17:51
free radicals.
17:52
And once the radicals develop, then the next part is just chemistry . So, from that point
17:57
of view, the effect after that pre radical formation has taken place is ah the same as
18:06
with any kind of chemical poisoning.
18:08
So, the way the cell is going to react to a nuclear accident, and the way it is going
18:18
to react to some chemical accident, there may not be too much different.
18:22
But of course, the fact is that for a nuclear accident, the affect may be very very prolonged
18:26
because the radioactivity may remain in the surrounding for a few hundred years as well.
18:32
So, these are the five different kinds of mechanisms of cell may undergoes apoptosis,
18:38
necrosis, senescence, autophagy and mitotic catastrophe.
18:45
Apoptosis is a highly regulated mechanism of cell death.
18:48
Distinct cytoplasmic and nuclear morphological changes are recognizable in cells undergoing
18:53
apoptosis, such as shrinkage of the cell, contraction and membrane blebbing, nuclear
18:59
condensation, fragmentation of the DNAs, and also cell destruction into membrane-bound
19:05
particles.
19:06
So, apoptosis is the most common type of cell killing process in fact, a body to replace
19:14
the old cell by the new one also follows apoptosis, apoptosis.
19:18
But apoptosis is the first most prominent kind of effect cell killing mechanism that
19:24
radiation can lead to there is an necrosis, necrosis is generally is considered as a tumor
19:31
cell death process that predominates after a high radiation dose treatment.
19:36
While at a lower dose, it has been indicated as a passive and unregulated event.
19:41
One thing we have to understand here the all the effect of radiation may not be bad because
19:47
treatment of carcinogenesis such kind of things also you makes use of high dose radiations.
19:54
And they are the objective radiation is to kill the affected tumor cells.
19:57
So, necrosis general is a primary mechanism there which leads to the cell killing.
