Hello and welcome back.
00:17
In today's lecture we will be looking at Dickens's historical fiction called A Tale of Two Cities.
00:24
Dickens wrote only two historical novels, the other one is Barnaby Rudge.
00:30
So A Tale of Two Cities is a very popular novel of Dickens and it is a set in the times
00:38
of the French Revolution.
00:39
If you remember in the previous weeks, we had a look; a very close look at Persuasion
00:47
by Jane Austen, and that fiction content, that fiction's content is domestic, it is
00:55
very romantic.
00:57
So today, in today's lecture we are looking at something which is quite, very distinct
01:02
to what we have looked at earlier.
01:05
Let me begin by offering the publication context of A Tale of Two Cities.
01:12
This novel was published in the weekly journal All The Year Round, and it was also published
01:19
as monthly parts, each month there was a section which was published with illustrations, and
01:27
those illustrations were done by this illustrator called Hablot K. Browne.
01:34
And this novel originated in 1859, and as you can see it is around the midpoint of the
01:42
19th century.
01:44
Let us look at the setting of the novel and the source of the novel.
01:50
As I mentioned a minute ago, this novel is set in the late 18th century against the background
01:56
of the French Revolution.
01:58
And Dickens borrowed heavily for his historical material from Thomas Carlyle's The French
02:05
Revolution, which was published in three volumes in 1837.
02:10
So French Revolution offers a lot of content for this novel, French Revolution is at the
02:18
heart of this novel, and we have also a plot which revolves around the domesticity of certain
02:26
key characters which also complicates the plot.
02:30
Let us look at the title page of this novel, and this illustration is done by Hablot Brown
02:41
who is also known by this term “phiz”.
02:44
So if you look at the picture we have one solitary elderly man writing on a piece of
02:55
paper, and if you have started reading the novel, you will know that that figure is Doctor
03:03
Manette who has been imprisoned in the Bastille for 18 long years.
03:08
So it is a very catchy title page.
03:12
And it is intended to catch the attention, the curiosity of the readers of that period.
03:23
This is how the novel begins, I have a big chunk of text on the slide for you, it is
03:31
one of the most famous lines in all of English literature, in all of world literature too
03:39
and it kind of sets up the scene, the tone and the mood of the novel.
03:46
This section is from the very first chapter of A Tale of Two Cities, in fact it is the
03:51
very first set of lines that begin the novel.
03:55
And as I mentioned just now, it gives you a kind of a hint, a thematic, metaphoric hint
04:04
as to the kind of issues, the kind of perspectives, the kind of contrasts that this novel is going
04:14
to talk about, explore, and present before the audience.
04:19
Let me first read the excerpt and then we will try to analyse the idea of duality or
04:26
twinness in this novel.
04:29
“It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom it was
04:36
the age of foolishness.
04:38
It was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of Light,
04:45
it was the season of Darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair,
04:51
we had everything before us we had nothing before us, we were all going direct to Heaven,
04:58
we were all going to direct the other way - in short, the period was so far like the
05:04
present period that some of its noisiest authorities insisted on its being received for good or
05:11
for evil in the superlative degree of comparison only.”
05:17
A very first reading of this section tells us that it is about contrast.
05:23
There are a lot of juxtaposed ideas, let me pick some of them.
05:32
It was the best of times, it was a very good time, and it was also the worst of times,
05:39
so you can easily see that dual aspects are explored here.
05:49
It was the age of foolishness, there was a lot of stupidity around, but at the same time
05:55
it was the age of wisdom too, there was a lot of understanding about life about what
06:03
is knowledge and other things.
06:04
So, again there is a set of contrasts presented to the reader here.
06:10
It was a period of hope, people believed that they will have a happy life; at the same time,
06:15
it was a period of despair.
06:19
See the spring of hope and the winter of despair is specifically mentioned there, and people
06:26
as I said believed that they were going to have good times ahead and at the same time,
06:31
people believed that they are going to have bad times coming at them.
06:36
So, it was a period which believed in extremes.
06:43
In fact, the narrator says that people kind of understood the period in the superlative
06:49
degree of comparison only.
06:51
So there is nothing moderate about this set of ideas that we have, light and darkness,
06:57
two distinct ideas, faith and disbelief, again two distinct set of ideas, so people believed
07:05
in extremes rather than coming to some kind of compromise or moderate understanding of
07:11
life.
07:12
It was either good or evil and this is set in the late 18th century, but the third person
07:22
narrator also mentions that this period, that is the 18th century period, was so far like
07:28
the present period, it is like the period in which the novel is being written at the
07:36
1850, so again there is also a comparison made between the 18th century; late 18th century,
07:42
and the middle of the 19th century.
07:45
So, again a lot of comparison is being made here.
07:50
Now, in this first chapter, a very interesting foreshadowing is being made by the third person
07:59
narrator.
08:03
Foreshadowing gives us a hint of things to come.
08:08
So what is the major event that is going to descend upon the people of France, let us
08:16
see that.
08:17
“It is likely that, rooted in the woods of France and Norway, there were growing trees,
08:23
when that sufferer was put to death, already marked by the Woodman, Fate, to come down
08:28
and be sawn into boards, to make a certain movable framework with a sack and a knife
08:34
in it, terrible in history.”
08:37
Let me give you the context for this particular passage, that context is related to this phrase
08:46
“that sufferer”.
08:47
In this chapter, the narrator mentions that people were put to death for the slightest
08:53
of mistakes that they committed, and one such example is being given of a boy who refused
09:00
to bow down and honour the procession of monks, and since he did not, you know, offer honour
09:07
to the sacred people, he was put to death.
09:12
And the narrator mentions that when this man was put to death, trees were cut down by this
09:20
Woodman, this very powerful Woodman Fate, and that tree was sawn into boards and that
09:27
set of framework was going to become a movable framework which will have a sack and a knife
09:33
in it, and you will know once you read the novel that this excerpt is referring to the
09:40
guillotine.
09:41
And that guillotine will kill thousands and thousands of people during the French Revolution,
09:48
and it is a terrible thing in history.
09:51
So a very interesting kind of connection is made between the horror of the boy who dies
10:06
to the woods, especially the trees which will be used to make that, you know, object called
10:17
guillotine which will kill thousands of people during that reign of terror.
10:25
So, all these are being foreshadowed at the beginning of a Tale of Two Cities.
10:32
And it is very interesting to see that play on words by Dickens there.
10:39
Woodman is compared to Fate, and Fate is using the woods to punish the people who have committed
10:47
grave crimes in society.
10:50
So, this is the framework that we are talking about, and this is a wooden framework
11:02
and this framework will punish people who have committed crimes against humanity.
11:14
And how is this guillotine operated?
11:16
It is clearly understood through a look at this picture.
11:21
So when that pulley is left down, is let down, the knife will fall across the neck and the
11:28
head will be chopped off, and the head will fall into a sack, and that sack is what is
11:33
being referred in this section.
11:37
And let me show you the knife, the knife will fall here across the neck.
11:46
“It is likely enough that in the rough outhouses of some tillers of the heavy lands adjacent
11:55
to Paris, there were sheltered from the weather that very day, rude carts bespattered with
12:02
rustic mire snuffed about by pigs and roosted in by poultry, which the farmer Death had
12:10
already set apart to be his tumbrils of the revolution.”
12:13
So, what is this except referring to?
12:16
In the earlier excerpt that I pointed out we were introduced to the idea of guillotine.
12:23
And now the narrator of the novel is introducing us to another object, perhaps the homely object
12:32
which is connected with the French Revolution, and that object is the tumbrel.
12:36
I will show you the picture of that object in a minute, but let us look closely at some
12:47
of the other metaphors used here.
12:51
Once again, the narrator points out that even before the revolution actually happened in
12:58
1789, there were things and activities which were set in motion which will bring that day
13:07
into action.
13:09
All these are employed by the people for the benefit of that day which is going to come.
13:16
And let me show you the picture of tumbrel, this is the tumbrel which will convey prisoners
13:25
to the guillotine, so these are all the condemned prisoners, and this cart is the tumbrel.
13:40
Dickens calls it the rude cart, which means humbly, humble or rustic, so just as Fate
13:52
which acted as the woodsman in cutting down trees which will be used to make the guillotine,
13:58
here too rude carts are being readied which will be employed, utilized during the revolution.
14:07
But at this point of time, years before what is happening to the rude carts which is kind
14:13
of bespattered with mire, pigs come and sniff at it, poultry roosts within the carts, but
14:21
ultimately the cart will be used by farmer Death.
14:25
What is interesting again in this set of excerpts is the fact that Dickens picks the metaphors
14:33
from the idea of farming, from the rural world.
14:38
Here, farmer becomes the agent of death.
14:42
Farmer who harvests, you know, grains, who harvest paddy using sickle becomes the agent
14:49
of death, and earlier Fate is compared to the woodsman who cuts down trees.
14:57
So all these metaphors are drawn from the humble, modest, rural lifestyle.
15:09
And now once again, the narrator brings together two concepts which we were talking about.
15:14
“But that Woodman and that Farmer, though they work unceasingly, work silently, and
15:20
no one heard them as they went about with muffled tread: the rather, forasmuch as to
15:26
entertain any suspicion that they were awake, was to be atheistically and traitorous.”
15:31
So what is being discussed in this excerpt?
15:36
Dickens says that this figure Woodman who is cutting down trees in order to make the
15:42
guillotine, and this man farmer who is the personification of Death, who will lead the
15:52
prisoners in rude carts to the guillotine, are working silently, unceasingly is without
16:02
stopping, and nobody is able to hear them as they walk about with quiet footsteps muffled,
16:10
you know, muffled is you cannot hear them distinctly; tread, tread is walking.
16:17
So they, why are they walking in such a quiet manner?
16:21
It is because they do not want to arouse the suspicion of anybody who is, you know, trying
16:28
to listen to them.
16:29
So, they do not want to wake anybody to this idea that things are set in motion which will
16:34
bring a lot of change in society.
16:38
So even to be aware of all these things is to be atheistic and traitorous, you will be
16:45
treasonous to the society even if you kind of think that these things are set in motion,
16:51
even if you harbour a hope or belief or expectation that these things will happen in society,
16:57
that a thing called French Revolution can come into play.
17:00
So, if you want to sum up the set of ideas that I have discussed so far, one is; things
17:09
are in extremes, life is understood in extremes because life is in extremes.
17:18
For example, there is a lot of, you know, divide between the rich and the poor, therefore
17:31
things are understood in extremes.
17:33
Life is either full of hope or life is full of despair, that is what the first section
17:42
told us very symbolically, either life is full of light or life is full of darkness.
17:49
So that is the idea that is being conveyed in that very first important passage.
17:54
And the other point that the narrator is trying to put forth here is that, you know, people
18:02
are not aware that things are set in motion which will bring about the French Revolution,
18:09
and all these things are happening metaphorically in the rural areas because that is where there
18:16
is a lot of want and deprivation.
18:19
So there is a foreshadowing of things to come.
18:26
And Dickens draws these metaphors from the rural world.
18:34
And those examples are clearly given there, which is that of the Woodman and the Farmer,
18:38
who are preparing certain objects, who are preparing certain transportation which will
18:45
punishment to those who had committed sins against the peasants.
18:51
Now, let us look at chapter 2 which is called The Mail.
18:57
The mail is the mail coach, so it is a basically a carriage which will, a horse-drawn carriage
19:11
which will transport people from one place to another.
19:14
So this is before the age of the railways, and we constantly need to remember that this
19:19
is late 18th century that we are in in this novel.
19:26
So we have an illustration here of a man stopping a mail coach, and this is the man who has
19:36
come with a particular message to one of the figures who is travelling by this mail coach.
19:43
And the man offers a letter to the passenger that he is interested in.
19:49
So this scene happens one Friday night late in November, and this is the description which
20:01
talks about the state of affairs at that particular night in November.
20:07
Why have I put this except there on the slide for you?
20:11
It is because to give you an idea of the kind of atmosphere that was there in those days,
20:19
and particularly in that particular day in November and that atmosphere is also metaphoric,
20:26
because it talks about various shades of you know, state of affairs that is happening in
20:33
the novel and which is also reflective of the society of that period
20:37
“There was a steaming mist in all the hollows, and it had roamed in its forlornness up the
20:45
hill, like an evil spirit seeking rest and finding none.
20:50
A clammy and intensely cold mist, it made its slow way through the air in ripples that
20:57
visibly followed and overspread one another, as the waves of an unwholesome sea might do.
21:04
It was dense enough to shut out everything from the light of the coach lamps but these
21:09
its own workings, and a few yards of road, and the reek of the labouring horses steamed
21:15
into it, as if they had made it all.”
21:19
Setting is pretty clear, it is late at night on a Friday in November, which means this
21:25
is winter.
21:28
And this is happening in a kind of a deserted space, there is no habitation, there is just
21:36
wild nature.
21:38
And at this point of time, there is mist everywhere, a steaming mist, as if it's, as if the mist
21:46
is kind of roaming everywhere, here and there, the mist is roaming, it is circulating, and
21:52
the mist is kind of personified as an evil spirit.
21:56
Look at the phrase evil spirit, so the mist is compared to this spirit, and this spirit
22:03
is restless as if it is kind of trying to seek rest and it is not finding any kind of
22:10
rest, and it is clammy, it is wet to the touch, it is intensely cold.
22:16
And it is kind of making its way slowly through the air and it is making visible ripples.
22:23
So it is a very evocative passage, what is the meaning of evocative?
22:30
It kind of brings a vivid picture on your mind.
22:34
And it is an unwholesome kind of mist too, it is not a very healthy mist, and it was
22:42
preventing visibility, it was dense enough to shut out everything from the light, see,
22:49
and again it reminds us of that first paragraph which begins the novel it was a season of
22:55
light and the same time it was the season of darkness.
22:57
So even though there is light from the coach lamps, that light is being shut out by the
23:04
mist, by this fog.
23:08
And even the horses are steaming, adding to this mist through their steamy breath.
23:16
So it is a very, very vivid picture that Dickens is painting through his third person narrator,
23:24
and it tells us of a day, or precisely the night in November, and it tells us metaphorically
23:33
that we are not able to clearly see what is happening around us.
23:38
So, this invisibility is symbolic of the lack of penetration that one suffers from in those
23:51
periods; it was difficult for someone to understand the workings of society at that period.
23:57
So, let us continue with this section on the mail, and this except that is there on the
24:07
slide tells us about the thoughts of the passengers who are inside the carriage, inside the mail
24:17
coach.
24:18
And the narrator says that, “Not one of these could have said, from anything he saw,
24:23
what either of the two was like; and each was hidden under almost as many wrappers from
24:28
the eyes of the mind, as from the eyes of the body of his two companions.”
24:34
So the narrator is philosophically pointing out that nobody inside the carriage was able
24:43
to understand what the other person was like, as well as understand what was going on in
24:50
that person's mind, because they were all wrapped up, and they were all covered, because
24:56
remember, it is a November night, it is the height of winter, it is very, very cold, so
25:00
everybody is nicely wrapped up with lots of clothes.
