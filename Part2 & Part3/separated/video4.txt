00:19
In our last two<emp> sessions 
<sp>
 , we were discussing about 
<sp>
 CVP or BEP analysis
<ft>
. 
<lp>

00:29
I hope you have understood the basic concepts now 
<sp>
 relating to 
{contri-}
 first about variable cost,
00:37
fixed cost, 
<sp>
 then the contribution margin, 
<sp>
 and then 
<sp>
 about the calculation of BEP
<rt>
. 
<sp>

00:45
We will just have a look at what is PV ratio, 
<sp>
 because it is a very important calculation 
<sp>

00:53
for any business, 
<sp>
 for any product or for any particular plan. 
<sp>

00:59

[So,]
 this is a relationship between the 
<sp>
 profit margin
<rt>
 or a contribution margin
<rt>
 as a percentage
01:08
to revenue
<ft>
. 
<lp>

01:09
So, we relate the 
<sp>
sales price to variable cost, we get the contribution margin, and
01:19
we divide it by selling price.
01:21

[So,]
 we known as a percentage suppose your sale of 10 lakhs, 
<sp>
 what is a gross margin or
01:29
what is a contribute margin you are earning
<ft>
 that is the PV ratio
<ft>
. 
<sp>

01:34
If sales go up from 10 lakhs to 11 lakhs, 
<sp>
 on the extra<emp> 1 lakh of sales, what is the
01:42
extra<emp> profit which you will earn 
<sp>
 that you get from PV ratio or contribution margin ratio
<ft>
. 
<sp>

01:51
Now, the calculation is done like this. 
<sp>

01:55
The basic formula was profit is equal to sales minus total cost
<rt>
, but we divide the total
02:01
cost into variable and fixed. 
<sp>

02:04
And the contribution
<rt>
 margin is a comparison between revenue<emp> and variable costs
<ft>
. 
<sp>

02:11
To calculate the profit 
<sp>
 now sales minus variable cost you get contribution
<rt>
. 
<sp>

02:19
From contribution we can deduct fixed cost to know the profit
<ft>
 
<sp>

02:24

[Now,]
 the upper part that is from sales variable cost and contribution
<rt>
 can be converted on
02:31
per unit basis, 
<sp>
 because all these three components
<rt>
 change as the number of units or the level
02:37
of activity changes
<ft>
 . 
<lp>
 
[Now,]
 this formula for profit is like this
02:43
now
<rt>
 S minus V into Q is minus FC is profit, 
<sp>
 or you can use it to calculate Q 
<sp>
 that is projected
02:54
quantity or the target quantity for certain level of profit
<ft>
.
02:59
So, now, FC plus expected profit is in the numerator
<rt>
 divided by S minus VC
<ft>
 
<sp>
 getting it? 
<lp>

03:09
Then we also discuss the BEP analysis, I am just keeping its uses etcetera. 
<lp>

03:17
We will go to formulae
<ft>
. 
<lp>

03:23
Now, for calculating BEP in unit terms, our target is to earn
<rt>
 fixed cost
<ft>
. 
<sp>

03:33
So, fixed cost is kept in the numerator
<rt>
, we divide it by contribution per unit.
03:41
If you want to make a short form you can say FC upon quantity per unit
<ft>
, 
<sp>
 always keep in
03:47
mind that fixed cost is not per unit
<ft>
, fixed cost is in total. 
<sp>

03:52
There is no sense to have fixed cost on a unit basis; it is a total fixed cost 
<sp>
 to be
03:58
recovered from certain number of units
<ft>
.
04:01
So, we divide it by contribution per unit
<rt>
, so that we know
<rt>
 
<sp>
 that how many units you need
04:08
to sell 
<sp>
 to recover that much of fixed cost
<ft>
 which is nothing but a break even
<ft>
. 
<sp>

04:14
Now, many times it is difficult to have per unit data of contribution . So, instead of
04:22
contribution per unit, we divide it by PV ratio 
<sp>
 formula.
04:26
Now, what is the formula of PV ratio
<rt>
 it is contribution upon sales
<ft>
. 
<sp>

04:31
So, as a percentage what is our margin
<rt>
 is our PV ratio 
<sp>
 we divide fixed cost by PV ratio
04:38
to get BEP<emp> in sales value
<ft>
. 
<lp>

04:44
Now, this is the CVP<emp> - cost volume profit graph, 
<sp>
 it is also called as breakeven chart
<ft>
.
04:56
Have a look at it carefully, it is very important and I think all concepts will become clear. 
<sp>

05:01
If you just look at it for 
<sp>
 few seconds, getting it
<rt>
.
05:07
So, you have got fixed cost which is a horizontal line 
<sp>
 not starting from 0, starting from certain
05:14
level
<ft>
 about 1 lakh in this example
<ft>
. 
<sp>

05:18
Then from there itself emerges a line going up 
<sp>
 which is a total<emp> cost line, 
<sp>
 because total
05:27
cost is never 0, 
[it is 0]
 at 0 units it is equal to fixed cost
<rt>
, and then its slowly goes
05:34
up 
<sp>
in the proportion in which variable costs are increasing
<ft>
 . 
<sp>

05:40
Then this red line is known as total sales sometimes called as TR or other the total
05:46
revenue line
<rt>
, it starts with 0 and it goes up at a particular point it crosses the TC
05:55
or the other total cost line
<ft>
. 
<sp>

05:58
This point is nothing but breakeven point
<ft>
 
<sp>
 , because at this point 
<sp>
 you are able to cover
06:06
all your costs and earn more revenue than your cost
<ft>
.
06:12
Every company always wants to above this level of sales
<ft>
. 
<sp>

06:16
Below
<rt>
 this level is what is known as loss area
<ft>
, because now your costs are more<emp> than
06:25
sales.
06:26
Above this level, 
<sp>
 your sales are more than costs
<rt>
.
06:30
So, you are in the profit area
<ft>
. 
<sp>

06:33
Once you cross breakeven
<rt>
 every extra contribution you earn 
<sp>
 is all your profit because fixed
06:41
costs are now covered 
<sp>
 . 
[So,]
 as the number of units increased, the profit area can go
06:47
on increasing and increasing, 
<sp>
 but the loss area is actually limited
<ft>
 
<sp>
 maximum<emp> loss is equal
06:54
to fixed cost at zero point
<ft>
, 
<sp>
 because fixed cost are the costs which we incur irrespective<emp>
07:01
of sales
<ft>
.
07:02
So, at zero you have incurred all your fixed costs the revenue is 0.
07:08
So, fixed cost is a maximum loss 
<sp>
 from there the loss goes on decreasing
<rt>
 it comes to 0
07:15
at 
<sp>
 breakeven point; and above this
<rt>
 you have got profit
<ft>
 that is why BEP is a very interesting
07:22
and important calculation for most of the companies or for plants
<rt>
 
<sp>
 , because they want
07:27
to at least break even
<ft>
 
[getting it.]

<rt>

07:31
Then we had discussed one illustration. 
<sp>

07:34
Now, taking from this 
<sp>
 we will take or we will discuss one more
<rt>
 concept I hope you remember
07:43
this illustration. 
<sp>

07:45
Now, suppose 
<sp>
 just have a look at this illustration once again.
07:51
Their estimated sales were given as 12000 bikes
<ft>
 
<sp>
 at which level 
<sp>
 they had earned a profit
08:01
of 5 lakhs
<ft>
. 
<lp>

08:04

[Now,]
 based on these there is a concept called as MOS<emp> or margin<emp> of safety<emp>. 
<sp>

08:13
We know that 
<sp>
 company at 12000 units is above breakeven point how much above it is is nothing
08:24
but margin of safety. 
<sp>

08:26
So, we had calculated breakeven point to be in terms of units at 11400. 
<lp>

08:35
The estimated sales are 12000
<ft>
, that means, 12 minus 11400, 600 bikes more
<rt>
 than breakeven
08:44
that is called as margin of safety in units.
08:48
It can also be calculated in sales terms
<rt>
 or it can be calculated as a percentage
<ft>
 
<sp>
 . So,
08:55
you are able to sell 12000 units; 
<sp>
 that means, you have a margin of 600
<ft>
.
09:03
So, 600 upon 12000
<ft>
 
<sp>
 this how MOS is is calculated as a percentage
<ft>
.
09:08
I will just show you the formula
<rt>
. 
<lp>

09:14

[Getting it?]

<rt>

09:15
Margin of safety is equal to
<rt>
 actual sales minus breakeven sales 
<sp>
 either in units you
09:22
can do
<rt>
 or you can in rupees you can do
<ft>
. 
<sp>

09:25
Another way of showing it is MOS as a percentage 
<sp>
 sales minus BEP
<ft>
 that is your MOS is in bracket 
<sp>

09:34
divided by actual<emp> sales. 
<sp>

09:38
Just keep in mind
<rt>
 that do not divide it by BEP  
<sp>
 some students mistake they calculator
09:44
MOS divide it by BEP that will also give you some answer
<rt>
, but that is not a margin of safety
09:50
as a percentage
<ft>
 
[getting it.]

<rt>

09:53
Now, this represents the safety available to business at current level of sales 
<sp>
 because
09:59
everybody wants to avoid<emp> losses . 
<sp>
 So, to avoid losses, you are above certain level of sales
10:06
how<emp> much<emp> you are above is the margin of safety
<ft>
. 
<sp>

10:09
Now, let us try to do one simple illustration
<ft>
 . 
<sp>

10:18
So, Prabha Devi Ornaments, they have sales of 5000 units
<rt>
, sale price is 50
<rt>
, variable
10:27
cost is 30
<rt>
, fixed cost is 35000
<rt>
. 
<sp>

10:32
Now, compute BEP quantity amount as well as MOS as a percentage
<ft>
 
<sp>
 . So, do this calculation 
<lp>

10:43
. So, how will you proceed?
<rt>
 
<lp>

10:49
Firstly
<rt>
, you have to compare 50 and 30 
<sp>
 because that is a primary profit you are earning. 
<sp>

10:59
What that is known as
<rt>
 
<sp>
 50 minus 30, I hope you remember that is called as a contribution<emp>
11:06
per unit
<ft>
 . 
<sp>
 So, one calculation you will do in the beginning is compute the contribution
11:13
per unit. 
<sp>

11:14
So, one unit you sell gives you 20 rupees
<ft>
.
11:19
How much you have to 
<sp>
 earn minimum, 
<sp>
 minimum you have to earn enough to cover<emp> your 35000
<ft>

11:27
because that is your fixed cost
<ft>
. 
<sp>

11:29
So, 35000 upon 20 is a BEP quantity
<ft>
.
11:34
You can convert the quantity into amount by multiplying it by 50 
<sp>
 or
<rt>
 you divide this 35000
11:44
by PV ratio
<ft>
. 
<sp>

11:45
So, how much is PV ratio
<rt>
 50 minus 30, 20 is a contribution divided by 50, 20 by 50
<ft>
. 
<sp>

11:56
So, 40<emp> percent is a PV ratio . Now, if you divide fixed cost by 40<emp> percent you will get
12:07
BEP amount
<ft>
. 
<sp>

12:09
Now, having calculated quantity and amount go for calculation of MOS
<ft>
. 
<sp>

12:16
I will show you the calculations
<rt>
. 
<lp>

12:21
I hope it is clear to you 
<sp>
 35000<emp> divided by 20, that means, 1750<emp> units 
<sp>
 is a breakeven
12:33
point.
12:34
You need to sell 1750<emp> units to recover<emp> 35000
<ft>
. 
<sp>

12:41
Now, in terms of sales value
<rt>
 you will have to first calculate PV ratio which is 20 by
12:48
50; that means, 40 percent 
<sp>
 35000 by 40 percent gives you 87500<emp> rupees
<ft>
 
<sp>
 that is BEP in terms
12:59
of rupees.
13:00
So, first two calculations we have done
<rt>
.
13:03
Now, next is MOS
<ft>
 
<sp>
 they have given a sales of 5000.
13:07
So, compute MOS percentage
<ft>
. 
<sp>

13:09
Now, 5000 is their sales level
<rt>
 and what you require is only 1750.
13:18

[So]
, difference between 5000 minus 1750 is their MOS
<rt>
, and then convert it into percentage
<ft>
 
<lp>

13:25

[ok.]

13:27

[So]
, margin of safety 5000 minus 1750 divided by their current sales 
[of]
 which is 5000.
<ft>

13:36

[So]
, you get 65<emp> percent. 
<sp>

13:41
What it means is
<rt>
 suppose their sale of 5000 starts falling 
<sp>
 let us say by 10 percent, 20
13:47
percent, 30 percent, 40 percent, they are still not in losses.
13:50
They will have to worry because sales are dropping, but it can go up to 65 percent<emp> before
14:00
which
<rt>
 they will not go in losses
<ft>
, that is why they have a margin<emp> of safety<emp> of 65<emp> percent
<ft>
.
14:09
Are you getting me?
<rt>

14:10
So, these were the simple illustrations.
14:13
Now, let us go 
<sp>
 to the cases which have been shared with you
<rt>
.
14:19
I hope you have got the printout. 
<sp>

14:21
If not please take the printout, you can stop this video here, take the printout and let
14:27
us try to solve 
<sp>
 those cases together
<ft>
 
[ok]

<rt>
.
14:33
So, you have been shared with five<emp> cases.
14:37
Let us go one by one.
14:40
Let us start with Ganesh . 
[So]
, Ganesh limited is selling 
<sp>
 three products in brand names A,
14:49
B and C. And these are the details of their cost structures.
14:55
So, you know the direct material labour and variable overheads 
<sp>
 which is 8, 8, 9 for product
15:02
a 
<sp>
 selling price is 35, same way for B and C. The monthly fixed cost is 
<sp>
 480000.
15:13
Now, they have given the sales volume for 2 months 
<sp>
 July and August.
15:19
So, two sales mixes of given
<ft>
 
<sp>
 in July it is same 20, 20 and 20000 for A, B, C. And in
15:28
August, it is something different. 
<sp>

15:31
Now, we have to do two things first find the monthly<emp> profits. 
<sp>

15:38
So, for both the months July and August, calculate the profits of the company
<rt>
.
15:45
And 
<sp>
 if your 
{call}
 calculations bring out 
<sp>
 that higher profit are earned in the month of lower volume
<rt>

15:53
kindly justify
<ft>
.
15:54
So, think over 
[why]
 why it is possible, is it possible, that lesser sales and more profits
16:01
. And second in part B 
<sp>
 , if sales mix of each
16:06
month is considered as two sales mixes say mix X 1 and mix X 2, compute the breakeven
16:13
point for each mix
<ft>
 
<sp>
 and which of the two mix do you recommend. 
<sp>

16:18
So, these two months are treated as two sales plans, 
<sp>
 and then we have to
<rt>
 calculate which
16:28
plan do you recommend
<ft>
 
<lp>
 . Ok
<rt>
, I hope you are getting it.
16:33
So, now, how will you go ahead
<rt>
, 
<sp>
 just think over. 
<lp>

16:41
I think most of you know by now that the first step is calculating the contribution<emp> per unit
<ft>
.
16:48
We know sales price; we know the variable costs. 
<sp>

16:52
So, compute the contribution . Based on contribution you can also compute the PV ratio for all
16:59
the three products . 
<sp>
 Now, you know the number of units sold in the month of July
<ft>
 .
17:06
So, contribution per number of units
<rt>
 will give you total<emp> contribution for July and for
17:15
August separately
<rt>
, from that deduct the fixed costs
<ft>
.
17:20
Contribution minus fixed costs gives you the proper 
<sp>
 in part a we have been asked to calculate
17:27
monthly<emp> profits, 
<sp>
 so that is the first thing you do it. 
<sp>

17:33
And then<emp> we will discuss 
<sp>
 as to which month has more profits
<ft>
 
<sp>
 you can just see that in
17:40
the month of July their total sales are 20 plus 20 plus 20 means 60000
<ft>
. 
<sp>

17:47
And in the month of August their sales have slightly gone down . So, let us see which
17:53
month gives you more profits
<ft>
 
<sp>
 ok
<rt>
 
<sp>
 . So, I am trying to show it in the excel
<rt>
 . But
18:01
you try to do it in your own 
<sp>
 note book.
18:05
These are the 3 months 
<sp>
 . Firstly, make a statement of contribution, and for PV ratio
<ft>
 
<sp>
 . So, please
18:14
make four columns 
<sp>
 particulars A, B, C. 
<sp>

18:19
We start with sale price 
<sp>
 which is 36
<rt>
, 55
<rt>
 and 58
<rt>
 from that 
<sp>
 deduct variable cost per unit
<ft>

18:36
for each of the three products 
<sp>
 . I hope you are doing it with me 
<lp>
 . So, please write down
18:52
the elements of variable cost 
<sp>
 , which is the DM, DL and variable overheads, which gives
18:59
us 
<sp>
 variable cost per unit . So, you have got 
<sp>
 8, 8 and 9. 
<lp>

19:11
So, take these figures here
<rt>
 
<lp>
 . Fine, you are getting it?
<rt>
 
<sp>

19:25
So, 8 plus 8 plus 9 means variable cost per unit is 25
<ft>
. 
<sp>

19:32
Selling price is 36
<rt>
, variable cost is 25
<rt>
, so contribution per unit is 
<sp>
 11
<ft>
. 
<sp>

19:41
So, from one unit of a
<rt>
 company is able to make contribution margin of 11.
19:51
And as a percentage it is 
<sp>
 0.306. 
<sp>

19:55
So, 11 upon 36<emp> will give you this ratio known as 
<sp>
 PV<emp> ratio
<ft>
 .
20:05
Now, in the same manner
<rt>
, take the data for product B which is 14, 8 and 20
<rt>
, please<emp> compute 
<sp>

20:21
the variable costs
<rt>
 the total variable cost
<rt>
 contribution
<rt>
 and PV ratio
<ft>
 
<lp>
 . So, how much have
20:30
you got
<rt>
, 
<lp>
 are you getting a contribution of 12?
<rt>
 
<lp>

20:48
Just have a look at the solution 
<sp>
 total VC is 42
<rt>
, 54 minus 42 means twelve rupees is
20:56
a contribution 
<sp>
 and PV ratio is 
<sp>
 0.22 
<lp>
 got it
<rt>
.
21:06
Now, do it for product C
<ft>
 
<lp>
 . I think I do not have to show the solution. 
<sp>

21:18
You can do it for C
<rt>
. 
<lp>

21:32
Are you getting contribution of 4 rupees?
<rt>
 
<lp>

21:38
And 0.06<emp> 
<sp>
 is the PV ratio
<ft>
 
<sp>
 . Please keep in mind for any case involving CVP 
<sp>
 analysis of
21:52
marginal costing 
<sp>
 the starting point will be calculation of contribution per unit
<ft>
 
<sp>
 . Sometimes
22:02
you know for unit, if you do not know you calculate the PV ratio
<ft>
 for that type of units
22:08
or for that line of activity
<rt>
, what is a margin companies able to earn, 
<sp>
 this calculation is
22:16
a starting point.
22:17
This is the first 
<sp>
 compulsory<emp> calculation
<ft>
.
22:22
Now, based on this
<rt>
 
<sp>
 let us make the calculation of monthly<emp> profits
<ft>
. 
<sp>

22:31

[So]
, please make a profitability statement for July now
<rt>
. 
<sp>

22:39
We know the selling price
<rt>
; we know the number of units
<ft>
. 
<sp>

22:45
So, you can easily calculate the sales. 
<lp>

22:51
You know the contribution per unit also from the contribution chart
<rt>
. 
<sp>

22:57
Apply<emp> those data and calculate the profit from each of the three products
<ft>
 
<sp>
 that will
23:05
become the total<emp> profit for the month of July
<ft>
 
<lp>
 . Are you able to do it?
<rt>

23:15
. So, 11 is a profit or contribution per unit
23:20
into 20000 
<sp>
 that means, 
<sp>
 
[2 lakh sorry 20yeah]
 220000 is a contribution 
<lp>
 . Now, there is no
23:36
point in deducting fixed cost because you do not know separately fixed cost for A 
<sp>
 , but
23:43
if you complete it for the whole<emp> company 
<sp>
 so 220 here, 440 for B, and 80000 for C
<ft>
 
<sp>
 that
23:58
means for a company as a whole 
<sp>
 , they are able to earn a contribution of 540000<emp>  
<sp>
 from a sale
24:11
of 2960000<emp>. 
<sp>

24:14
From this 
<sp>
 deduct fixed cost of 
<sp>
 480000, 
<sp>
 now 540 minus 480, you get a profit o   
<sp>
 60000<emp>.
24:28
Are you getting it?
<rt>
 
<lp>

24:33

[Ok]
, I hope you have calculated the profit for July
<rt>
.
24:38
Now continue the same process 
<sp>
 calculate the profitability for August
<ft>
. 
<lp>

24:46
Again you know the selling price and contribution 
<sp>
  actually you do not have to calculate the
24:55
total sales, they do not play much role. 
<sp>

24:58
What we really<emp> want is called total contribution
<rt>
 and deduct it from fixed cost
<ft>
 
<sp>
 fixed cost is
25:05
not going to change
<rt>
.
