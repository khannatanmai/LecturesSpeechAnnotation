Hello friends
<rt>
, 
{uh}
 today we are looking to finish the tenth module of our course, where we are
00:33
talking about the biological effect of radiation. 
<sp>

00:37

{uh}
 You definitely have gone through the first lecture by now
<rt>
 and 
{uh}
 actually I am having a
00:41
quite a bit of gap between the time I record to the previous
<rt>
 lecture and this one has I
00:45
was down
<rt>
 a bit with fever and cough and cold.
00:48
And even today
<rt>
 also my voice is quite a bit restricted hopefully I can Skype through .
00:54
Just to have a recap of what we have done in the previous
<rt>
 lecture 
[ah]
 first you are introduced
01:00
to the different units
<rt>
 of radiation doses that we generally use 
[like]
.
01:05
Just to 
[ah]
 associate with radioactivity
<rt>
, 
[you are]
 very early 
[we are associate]
 you were introduced
01:13
to the units like urieo bacral which are associate with the radioactive disintegration
<ft>
.
01:18
But when we are talking about the biological effects of radiation
<rt>
 we have to look for new
01:23
units and 
{uh}
 their units like rongio red and that came into picture which are conversion
01:30
in one of the three arts of radiation or the SI versions
<rt>
 of them gray and Sievert.
01:36
So, you are introduce to those 
<sp>
. And also several associated factors like different
01:42
tissues respond differently to radiation accordingly we 
<sp>
 use some kind of tissue infector these
01:48
are introduced .
<sp>
 Then
<rt>
 you are introduced the concept of linear energy transfer, which is
01:53
actually some kind of 
{uh}
 potential
<rt>
 or stopping
<rt>
 power of a tissue against radiation . 
<sp>
 
[Or against]

02:01

[a]
 as different tissues respond differently or the same
<emp>
 tissue I can say respond differently
02:06
to different particle depending on their mass and energy level 
<sp>
 which is given measurement
02:11
above in terms of the LET . Then
<rt>
 you have to 
[ah]
 you are introduce to different
02:17
sources of radiation, living being can receive radiation from 
<sp>
 infinite number of sources
02:23
like 
[we can]
 we are always subjected to some kind of so called background radiation which
02:28
inverse the cosmic radiations and 
<sp>
 the rays coming from the outside atmosphere . 
<sp>
 Also
<rt>

02:35
there can be radiatic particle there are going interior to our body or inside our body through
02:39
the foods that you are taking .
<sp>
 There can be particles which are going with air during
02:46
the inhalation process . 
{uh}
 And also
<rt>
 nowadays with increase in the medical
02:52
equipments, 
<sp>
 there are significant fraction of 
[radiation]
 radiation
<rt>
 being contributed by
02:58
different kind of medical instruments
<emp>
 like where instruments like MRI which does not
<rt>

03:04
require any kind of radiation dose 
[introduces any radiation]
 does not introduce any kind
03:09
of radiation effect . Very general or simple kind of 
[ah]
 technique like an x-ray
[ah]
can
03:18
impose radiation equivalent to 11 days of natural radiation.
03:24
Whereas CT scan which is again a quite common technology nowadays that just one sitting
03:29
of hit CT scan can lead to 
<sp>
 radiation exposure to your body which is equivalent to 365 days
03:35
that is one full year of natural radiation or
<rt>
 more than 13 days of flying .
03:41
Of course
<rt>
, when you are flying or you are at higher altitude
<rt>
 you are exposed to larger
03:45
amount of cosmic radiation and that is why
<rt>
 flying also induces quite a bit of radioactive
03:53
effect.
03:54
Now, 
[in our]
 on our body, but this modern medical equipments which involves radiation 
<sp>
 like-x
03:59
rays or any kind of scans, they also can have significant effect
<ft>
 and therefore, we need
04:06
to be very very careful before undergo any such kind of 
[them]

<ft>
 .
04:11
Then we have discussed about the biological effects of radiation
<rt>
 and the cellular effect
04:15
of radiation
<ft>
.
04:16
You have seen the cellular effects of radiation can be of two types
<rt>
, primarily one
<emp>
 is the
04:22
indirect effect which leads to the 
<sp>
 particle radical formation 
<sp>
 as our cell primarily comprises
04:32
of cytoplasm
<rt>
 and water is the main component
<rt>
 of the cytoplasm.
04:37
So, the radiation generally breaks the H 2 O molecule there
<rt>
 leading to the formation
04:42
of several very dangerous kind of 
[ah]
 radicals such as the 
<sp>
 peroxide the hydroxyl and also
04:51
so called the superoxides.
04:52
They all
<emp>
 can have important effects or important detrimental
<rt>
 effects on the cell.
05:01
And there can be direct effect also whether radiation can change the demorphidology
<ft>
 or
05:06
the morphology of the DNA itself
<ft>
 we shall be looking more into them in
<rt>
 today's lecture
<ft>
.
05:11
Now, the terms for introduce in a last lecture itself, but let us 
[look]
 look a bit more into
05:18
this two terminologies that is what where the biological effects radiation may have
<rt>

05:22
they are generally classified into two categories, one is stochastic, and other deterministic
05:26
or sometimes called the nonstochastic effect
<ft>
.
05:28
The deterministic effect
<rt>
 generally refers to those kind of phenomenon where or which
05:35
appears only once a threshold dose of radiation is based
<ft>
 that is
<rt>
 if the radiation exposure
05:42
is less than the threshold, then you will not find any kind of effect or only
<emp>
 when the
05:47
threshold is reached the effect becomes prominent .
05:51
But once you have reach the threshold
<rt>
 increasing the dose beyond that 
[ah]
 keeps worsening the
05:57
effect
<ft>
.
05:58
So,
[ah]
the behavior can be 
[means]
 if we 
<sp>
 plot something like this, where effect on this
06:05
side and the dose on this side tills if this is a threshold then below
<rt>
 this threshold you
06:10
will not find any kind of effect, but above the threshold
<rt>
 effect keep some increasing
06:14
very very shortly . So, this is what we called the deterministic effect.
<ft>

06:20
Deterministic effects generally are immediate effects or short-term effects .
06:24

{uh}
 Once the threshold is reached they are guaranteed to appear.
06:29
And also
<rt>
 
<sp>
 the threshold value actually depends upon 
{uh}
 the particular person or particular place
06:37
which is subjected to radiation because 
{uh}
 different person or in fact, the different tissues of
06:44
the same person have different values for this threshold
<rt>
.
06:48
And also which kind of effect is going to appear accordingly the threshold is also going
06:53
to vary
<rt>
 . And any early effect as I have mentioned and most of the normal tissue late effects
07:00
are
<rt>
 deterministic or non-stochastic in nature
<ft>
.
07:03
These are some typical values of the threshold corresponding to the deterministic effect
<ft>

07:09
like 
[ah]
 generally 
[the]
 
{uh}
 the genital organs are the most affected by the radiation.
07:15
And as you can see here
<rt>
 when 
[they are subjected to]
 say the testis is subjected to a single
07:21
absorption dose of strength 3.5 to 6 Sievert 
[as be]
 then 
{uh}
 that is actually quite high dose
07:29
or
<rt>
 a prolonged absorption of measuring to year then that will lead to a permanent infertility.
07:39
Ovaries even more sensitive generally the female genitalia is much more sensitive to
07:44
the male genitalia that is why the value is even smaller
<ft>
 even 10
<emp>
 times smaller to this
07:51
. The lens of eye that is also very very sensitive
07:56
to this when it is subjected to a radiation dose of something like 0.5 to 2 Sievert only,
08:02
it can result to a milky of lens.
08:05
For a scatter lock function may appear with a dose of 5 Sievert or greater than 0.15 Sievert
08:11
here
<ft>
 for prolongment radiation dose.
<ft>

08:17
And bone marrow probably is the most sensitive kind of tissue or sensitive kind of part of
08:24
the body related to radiation effects with a very relatively smaller radiation dose of
08:31
only 0.5
<emp>
 Sievert it can lead to the blood forming deficiency.
<ft>

08:37

[So]
, and also this data are quite a bit old
<rt>
, but still very much valid.
08:41
These are recommendation given by the well known ICRP
<rt>
 that is International Commission
08:45
on Radiation Protections who generally says the standard for any kind of 
{uh}
 radiation based
08:52
guidelines
<ft>
 . Now, putting this in 
{uh}
 comparison with stochastic effect, first stochastic effect
<rt>

08:59
there is no such threshold dose.
09:01
So
<rt>
, stochastic effect whether that will appear or not that does not depend upon the magnitude
09:06
of the radiation
<ft>
 that the object is being subjected to.
<ft>

09:11
Rather
<rt>
 there more likely
<emp>
 with increasing the dose.
09:16
Or I can say that
<rt>
 the the severity of the stochastic effect does not depend upon the
09:22
intensity of the dose
<rt>
, but as the dose intensifies 
[the]
 their appearance is more likely.
09:30
So, we cannot say that for 
{uh}
 this particular dose, this kind of stochastic effect is going
09:37
to appear or not.
09:38
But of course
<rt>
, they are more likely
<ft>
 . And also there is no dose; however, stochastic
09:45
effect starting to occur, they may not at all appear
<rt>
, but also they can appear with
09:50
quite a small dose, because generally the effect is cumulative when someone is subject
09:54
to a occur small dose for a very prolong period, 
<sp>
 then the stochastic effect can appear.
09:59
But I repeat
<rt>
 if the strength of the dose is more
<rt>
, then there more likely to appear
<rt>
, but
10:05
the severity of the diseases severity of the effect is has no relation with the strength
10:11
of the dose.
<ft>

10:13
And stochastic effect actually concerns much larger
<emp>
 or more catastrophically effects of
10:20
radiations such as the carcinogenesis and also the gene 
[genet]
 defects or DNA nutritions leading
10:27
to hereditary effects
<ft>
 . So, stochastic effects are long term effects, and 
{uh}
 they are also quite
10:34
difficult to spot
<rt>
, whereas deterministic or non-stochastic effects are immediate effects
10:38
and they appear once their threshold is breached.
10:41
Now we need to gets some idea about the human cell cycle
<emp>
.
10:45
Each human cell undergoes quite a few difference stages of development
<ft>
 . The first stage of
10:53
importance
<rt>
 is the G 1 stage like shown in the diagram
<rt>
 they are principally four
<emp>
 or five
10:59
stages . Once the first stage is the G 1 phase
<rt>
, which is the growth phase
<rt>
 or growth phase
11:06
one
<rt>
 during the cell growth.
11:09
And at the end of G 1 phase
<rt>
, it is ready to replicate the DNA
<rt>
 then is the S phase when
11:15
the DNA replication happens
<rt>
.
11:18
Then because to the G 2 phase where the DNA replication is already done, so they makes
11:24
further growth and ensures that it is ready for cell division and then the most important
<rt>

11:29
one the mitosis
<rt>
 during which the cell divides into two.
11:33
And cytokinesis actually is a follow up step of mitosis sometimes called a part of the
11:37
mitosis itself
<rt>
 . And some cells may have an intermediate G naught stage as well
<rt>
, where
11:45
many human body cells may exit the cell cycle remain in a resting position or some kind
11:52
of neutral position for some time into some cells may remain there for a very
<emp>
, very long
11:59
time and that is referred to as a G naught phase
<ft>
.
12:04
Now
<rt>
, scientist have done some experiments to understand which
<emp>
 particular phase of this
12:11
human cell cycle
<rt>
 is most vulnerable to radiations
<ft>
 . And to facilitate that what they have done
<rt>

12:19
they have chosen
[ah]
different cell samples and applying some kind of sophisticated techniques,
12:25
they have ensured that
<rt>
 their cell cycles are exactly following the same timings that is
12:31
they are perfectly synchronous with each other . Once they have developed quite a few cell
12:35
colonies which are perfectly synchronous with each other
<rt>
 
<sp>
 then different cell colonies were
12:39
subjected to different amounts of radiation and also in different phases of their
<rt>
 individual
12:45
cell cycles
<ft>
 . And it has been observed that a cell is the
12:50
most vulnerable to radiation
<rt>
 when that is going to the mitosis process
<rt>
 or
<emp>
 about to go
12:56
through the mitosis process
<ft>
 . When we subjected to radiation in the other phases like G 1
13:02
phase or S phase or early part of G 2 phase
<rt>
, effect of radiation is quite small
<ft>
 , but
<rt>
 when
13:08
it is going to the mitosis then only
<rt>
 it is most vulnerable or it is about to start the
13:13
mitosis somewhere here
<rt>
 then also it is very much vulnerable
<ft>
 . And there is a reason also.
13:21
Like we know that inside the cell there are different kinds of components.
13:25
Now
<rt>
, if radiation effects 
[ah]
 some of the components say if it is effects a mitochondria, the mitochondria
13:32
may get permanently damaged, but inside a cell there can be several mitochondrion
<rt>
 and
13:37
therefore
<rt>
, just damaging one may not 
[ah]
 affect the cell performance too much
<ft>
, but once the
13:44
radiation effects the nucleus
<emp>
 then the radiation is definitely going to be 
[the]
 very important
13:51
and the cell is going to suffer, because nucleus is a main part of the cell and that is unique
13:56
. And
<rt>
 the nucleus
<emp>
 is 
{uh}
 in the most vulnerable
<rt>

14:01
position when it is going to the mitosis.
<ft>

14:04
This is a very rough schematic representation of cell division where both mitosis and meiosis
14:11
are shown.
14:12
Meiosis is a one during which the chromosomal exchanges happens, but 
[ah]
 that is not of our
14:18
interest
<rt>
.
14:19
Let us focus on mitosis only.
14:21
There are principally four different phases
<rt>
, prophase, metaphase, anaphase and telophase,
14:25
and sometimes also fifth follow phases cytokinesis which is more like a post processing phase.
<ft>

14:31
During the prophase phase
<rt>
 the chromosomes are duplicated
<ft>
 this is where the chromosomes
14:36
are duplicated
<rt>
.
14:38
So, initially 
<sp>
 
[if there are]
 
<sp>
 if there are n pairs of chromosomes like it this is a parent
14:48
cell
<rt>
 where there are in this diagram, there are four chromosomes.
14:51
The chromosomes are initially duplicated in the prophase phase leading to
<rt>
 four chromosomes
<ft>

14:57
. 
[And now]
 our four pairs of chromosomes I should say.
15:02
And then this chromosomes align each other along the metaphase plane during the metaphase
15:08
process, and then they subsequently separate out to
<rt>
 develop to new daughter cells during
15:15
the anaphase getting completed during the
<rt>
 telophase process.
<ft>

15:18
Accordingly we get two different daughter cells which are identical to the parent cell.
15:23
Mitosis is the most common type of cell division that we can see and 
{uh}
 that is the one that is
15:29
responsible for development of our body from a single cell embryo to 
<sp>
 a fully grown 
[human]

15:37

[person]
 human body.
<ft>

15:39
So,
<sp>
 if mitosis is affected by radiation
<rt>
 then there can be real catastrophe effect
<ft>
 and something
15:49
known as cell killing.
15:51
Cell killing refers to
<rt>
 reproductive date of a certain fraction of cell colonies when subjected
15:56
to acute radiation.
<ft>

15:58
Like when a cell is affected by radiation
<rt>
, then 
[ah]
 the cell may loses reproductive power,
16:06
and accordingly it is terminology wise it is called the cell is being killed
<ft>
 that is
16:11
cell killing
<rt>
 or causing the reproductive death that depends and upon the level of the dose.
<ft>

16:17
Again experiments are conducted with different cell colonies being subjecting them to 
<sp>
 different
16:23
levels of radiation, and then observing what fraction of that has suffered this cell killing.
16:29
And
<rt>
 it has been found to be proportional to the LET again.
<rt>

16:32
Like in case of high LET radiation
<rt>
 it is a very, very short decline.
16:37
You can see it is a vertical straight line which is going down very very rapidly.
16:43
Here one thing of importance here is a vertical scale is a logarithmic scale
<rt>
 and so
<emp>
 the change
16:48
is extremely rapid . Whereas for low LET radiation
<rt>
, the change is very small particular in this
16:54
part, there is very little
<emp>
 change, it is increasing only later on
<ft>
 . So, for a high LET radiation
17:02
dose
<rt>
, the effect of 
[for]
 radiation causing the cell killing is very, very prominent.
17:12
And now
<rt>
 
{uh}
 this cell killing can be of five different types
<ft>
 which are shown here.
17:19

[ah]
 (Refer Time: 17:21) subjective radiation can follow different kinds of roots all accessories
17:24
several kinds of enzymes and chemical processes.
17:28
One thing you have to
<rt>
 remember here is that the 
<sp>
 while we are talking about the effect
17:34
of radiation on cell killing, actually all the effects are more or less chemically in
17:38
nature
<ft>
 particular the indirect effect of radiation . Because
<rt>
 a cell compresses a several kinds
17:44
of chemicals and 
{uh}
 as we have already seen the indirect effect of radiation is to develop
17:51
free radicals.
<ft>

17:52
And once the radicals develop
<rt>
, then the next part is just chemistry
<ft>
 . So, from that point
17:57
of view, the effect after that pre radical formation has taken place
<rt>
 is 
[ah]
 the same as
18:06
with any kind of chemical poisoning.
<ft>

18:08
So
<rt>
, the 
<sp>
 way the cell is going to react to a nuclear accident
<rt>
, 
<sp>
 and the way it is going
18:18
to react to some chemical accident
<rt>
, there may not be too much different.
<ft>

18:22
But of course, the fact is
<rt>
 that for a nuclear accident, the affect may be very very prolonged
18:26
because the radioactivity may remain in the surrounding for a few hundred
<emp>
 years as well.
18:32
So, these are the five different kinds of mechanisms of cell may undergoes apoptosis
<rt>
,
18:38
necrosis
<rt>
, senescence
<rt>
, autophagy
<rt>
 and mitotic catastrophe.
<ft>

18:45
Apoptosis
<rt>
 is a highly regulated mechanism of cell death.
<ft>

18:48
Distinct cytoplasmic and nuclear morphological changes are recognizable in cells undergoing
18:53
apoptosis
<rt>
, such as shrinkage of the cell
<rt>
, contraction and membrane blebbing
<rt>
, nuclear
18:59
condensation
<rt>
, fragmentation of the DNAs
<rt>
, and also cell destruction into membrane-bound
19:05
particles.
<ft>

19:06
So, apoptosis is the most common type of cell 
{uh}
 killing process 
{uh}
 in fact, a body to replace
19:14
the old cell by the new one also follows 
[apoptosis]
, apoptosis.
19:18
But apoptosis is the first most prominent kind of effect cell killing mechanism that
19:24
radiation can lead to
<ft>
 there is an necrosis, necrosis
<rt>
 is generally is considered as a tumor
19:31
cell death process
<rt>
 that predominates after a high radiation dose treatment.
<ft>

19:36
While at a lower dose
<rt>
, it has been indicated as a passive and unregulated event.
<ft>

19:41
One thing we have to understand here the all the effect of radiation may not be bad because
19:47
treatment of carcinogenesis such kind of things also you makes use of high
<emp>
 dose radiations.
19:54
And they are
<rt>
 the objective radiation is to kill the affected tumor cells
<ft>
.
19:57
So, necrosis general is a primary mechanism there
<rt>
 which leads to the cell killing.
<ft>
