00:14
Hello and welcome back. <sp> {uh} 
00:17
In today's lecture<rt> we will be looking at Dickens's historical fiction<rt> called <sp> A Tale of Two Cities<ft>.
00:24
{uh} Dickens wrote only two<rt> historical novels<rt>, the other one is Barnaby Rudge<ft>.
00:30
[So] A Tale of Two Cities is a very popular novel of Dickens<rt> and it is <sp> [a] set in the times
00:38
of the French Revolution<ft>.
00:39
If you remember in the previous <sp> weeks, we had a look; a very close look at Persuasion<rt>
00:47
by Jane Austen<rt>, and [that fiction content,] that fiction's content is domestic<ft>, it is
00:55
very<rt> romantic<ft>.
00:57
So [today,] in today's lecture we are looking at something which is quite, very distinct<rt>
01:02
to what we have looked at earlier<ft>.
01:05
Let me begin by offering the publication context of A Tale of Two Cities<ft>.
01:12
This<rt> novel was published in the weekly journal<rt> All The Year Round<rt>, and it was also published
01:19
as monthly<rt> parts<ft>, each month there was a section which was published<rt> with illustrations, and
01:27
those illustrations were done by this<rt>illustrator called Hablot K. Browne<ft>.
01:34
And this novel originated in 1859<rt>, and as you can see it is <sp> around the midpoint of the
01:42
19th century<ft>. <sp>
01:44
Let us look at the setting<emp> of the novel and the source<emp> of the novel.
01:50
As I mentioned {uh} a minute ago<rt>, this novel is set in the late 18th century against the background
01:56
of the French Revolution<ft>. <sp>
01:58
And <sp> Dickens borrowed heavily for his historical material<rt> from Thomas Carlyle's The French
02:05
Revolution<rt>, which was published {uh} in three volumes in 1837<ft>. <sp>
02:10
So French Revolution offers a lot of content for this novel, <sp> {uh} French Revolution is at the
02:18
heart of this {uh} novel<rt>, and we have also {uh} a plot which revolves around the domesticity of certain
02:26
key characters which also complicates the plot<ft>. <lp>
02:30
Let us look at the title page of this novel<rt>, and this illustration is done by Hablot {uh} Brown<rt>
02:41
who is also known by this <sp> term “phiz”.<ft> <lp>
02:44
So if you look at the picture we have {uh} one solitary elderly man<rt> {uh} writing<rt> {uh} on a piece of
02:55
paper<rt>, and if you have {uh} started reading the novel, you will know that that figure is <sp> Doctor
03:03
Manette<ft> who has been imprisoned in the Bastille for <sp> 18 long<emp> years<ft>.
03:08
So it is a very catchy title page.
03:12
And it is intended to catch the attention<emp>, the curiosity<emp> of the readers of that period<ft>. <lp>
03:23
This is how the novel begins<rt>, I have a big chunk of text on the slide for you<rt> <sp> , it is
03:31
one of the most famous<emp> lines in all of English literature<rt>, in all of world literature too<rt>
03:39
and it kind of sets up the scene<emp>, the tone<emp> and the mood<emp> of the novel<ft>.
03:46
This section is from the very first chapter<emp> of A Tale of Two Cities, in fact it is the
03:51
very first set of lines <sp> that begin the novel.
03:55
And as I {uh} mentioned just now<rt>, it gives you a kind of a hint<emp>, a thematic, metaphoric hint<rt>
04:04
as to <sp> {uh} the kind of {um} issues<emp>, the kind of perspectives<rt>, the kind of contrasts that this novel is going
04:14
to<rt> talk about, explore, and present before the audience<ft>.
04:19
Let me first read the excerpt<rt> and then we will try to analyse the<rt> idea of duality or
04:26
twinness<emp> in this novel<ft>. <sp>
04:29
“It was the best of times<rt>, <sp> it was the worst of times<rt>, <sp> it was the age of wisdom<rt> it was
04:36
the age of foolishness.
04:38
It was the epoch of belief<rt>, it was the epoch of incredulity<rt>, it was the season of Light<rt>,
04:45
it was the season of Darkness<rt>, it was the spring of hope<rt>, it was the winter of despair,
04:51
we had everything before us <sp> we had nothing before us <sp> , we were all going direct to Heaven<rt> ,
04:58
we were all going to direct the other way - in short, the period was so far like the
05:04
present period<rt> that some of its noisiest authorities insisted on its being received for good or
05:11
for evil <sp> in the superlative degree of comparison only<ft>.”
05:17
A very<rt> first reading of this section tells us that <sp> it is about contrast<ft>. <lp>
05:23
There are a lot of <sp> juxtaposed ideas, {uh} let me pick some of them<ft>. <sp>
05:32
It was the best of times<rt>, it was a very good time<rt>,  <sp> and it was also<rt> the worst of times,
05:39
so you can easily see that dual aspects are <sp> explored here<ft>. <lp>
05:49
It was the age of foolishness, there was a lot of stupidity around, but at the same time<rt>
05:55
it was the age of wisdom too, there was a lot of understanding about <sp> life about what
06:03
is knowledge and other things<ft>.
06:04
So, again<rt> there is a set of contrasts presented to the reader here<ft>.
06:10
It was a period of hope<rt>, people believed that they will have a happy life; at the same time,
06:15
it was {uh} a period of despair<ft>.
06:19
See the spring of hope and the winter of despair is {uh} {spec-} specifically mentioned there<rt>, <sp> and people
06:26
as I said believed that they were going to have good times ahead<rt> and at the same time,
06:31
people believed that they are going to have bad times coming at them<rt>.
06:36
[So], {uh} <sp> it was a period which believed in extremes<emp>. <lp>
06:43
In fact, the narrator says that people kind of understood the period in the superlative
06:49
degree of comparison only<rt>.
06:51
So there is nothing moderate about this set of ideas that we have, light and darkness,
06:57
two distinct ideas<rt>, faith<emp> and disbelief<emp>, again two distinct set of ideas<rt>, so {uh} people believed
07:05
in extremes rather than coming to some kind of compromise or moderate understanding of
07:11
life<rt>.
07:12
It was either good or evil<emp> and<rt> this is set in the late 18th century<rt>, but<emp> the third person
07:22
narrator also mentions that {um} this period, that is the 18th century period<rt>, was so far like
07:28
the present period<rt> <sp> , it is like the period in which the novel is being written at the
07:36
1850<rt>, so again there is also a comparison made between [the 18th century;] late 18th century,
07:42
and the middle of the 19th century<ft>.
07:45
So, again a lot of comparison is being made here<rt>. <lp>
07:50
Now<rt>, {uh} in this first chapter, a very interesting foreshadowing is being {uh} made<emp> by the third person
07:59
narrator<rt>. <lp>
08:03
Foreshadowing gives us a hint of things <sp> to come. <sp>
08:08
So what is the <sp> major event that is going to descend upon the people<rt> {um} of France, let us
08:16
see that.
08:17
“It is likely that {uh} , rooted in the woods of France and Norway, there were growing trees<rt>,
08:23
when that sufferer was put to death, already marked by the Woodman, Fate<rt>, to come down
08:28
and be sawn into boards<rt>, to make a certain movable framework with a sack and a knife
08:34
in it, terrible in history<ft>.” <sp> {uh}
08:37
Let me give you the context for this particular passage<rt>, that context is related to this phrase
08:46
“that sufferer”. <sp>
08:47
In this chapter<rt>, the narrator mentions that people were put to death<emp> for the slightest
08:53
of mistakes that they committed<rt>, and one such example is being given <sp> of a boy who refused
09:00
to bow down and honour<rt> the procession of monks<rt>, and since he did not, {um} [you know,] offer honour
09:07
to <sp> the sacred people, he was put to death<ft>.
09:12
And the narrator mentions that <sp> when this man was {um} put to death, trees were cut down<rt> by {uh} this
09:20
Woodman, this very powerful Woodman Fate<rt>, and that tree was sawn into boards and that {uh}
09:27
set of framework was going to {uh} become a movable framework which will have a sack and a knife
09:33
in it, and you will know once you read the novel that this excerpt is referring to the
09:40
guillotine<rt>.
09:41
And that guillotine will kill thousands and thousands of people <sp> during the French Revolution,
09:48
and it is a terrible thing in history.
09:51
So a very interesting kind of connection is made between {um} the horror<rt> <sp> of the boy<rt> <sp> who dies<rt>
10:06
to <sp> the woods<ft>, especially the trees<rt> <sp> which will be used to make that {um} , [you know,] object called
10:17
guillotine<rt> <sp> which will kill thousands of people <ft> during that<rt> {um} reign of terror<ft>.
10:25
So, all these are being foreshadowed at the beginning of a Tale of Two Cities<ft>. <sp>
10:32
And it is very interesting to see that play on words<emp> by {uh} Dickens there.
10:39
Woodman is compared to Fate, and Fate is using the woods to punish the people who have committed
10:47
grave crimes {um in} in society.
10:50
So, this is the framework that we are talking about, and this is a wooden framework <lp>
11:02
and this framework will<emp> punish people who have committed crimes against humanity<ft>. <lp>
11:14
And how is this guillotine operated?<rt>
11:16
It is clearly {uh} understood through a look at this picture.
11:21
So when that pulley is left down<rt>, is let down, the knife will fall {uh} across the neck<rt> and the
11:28
head will be chopped off<ft>, and the head will fall into a sack<rt>, and that sack is what is
11:33
being referred in this {uh} section. <sp>
11:37
And let me show you the knife, the knife will fall<emp> here<emp> across the <sp> neck. <lp>
11:46
“It is likely<rt> enough that in the rough outhouses of some tillers of the heavy lands adjacent
11:55
to Paris<rt>, there were sheltered from the weather that very day, rude<emp> carts bespattered with
12:02
rustic mire snuffed about by pigs and roosted in by poultry, which the farmer Death had
12:10
already set apart to be his tumbrils of the revolution<ft>.”
12:13
So, what is this except referring to?<ft>
12:16
In the earlier excerpt that I pointed out we were introduced to the idea of guillotine<emp>.
12:23
And now the narrator of the novel is introducing us to another<emp> object, perhaps the homely<emp> object
12:32
which is connected with the French Revolution, and that object is the <sp> tumbrel<ft>.
12:36
I will show you the {uh} {picture of that uh} picture of that object in a minute<rt>, but let us look closely at some
12:47
of the other metaphors used here<rt>. {um}
12:51
Once again, the narrator points out that even before the revolution actually happened<emp> in
12:58
1789<rt>, there were things and activities which were set in motion<emp> which will bring that {uh} day
13:07
into action<ft>.
13:09
All these are employed by the people for the benefit of that day which is going to come.
13:16
And {um} let me show you the picture of tumbrel <lp> , this is the tumbrel which will convey prisoners
13:25
to the guillotine<emp>, so these are all the condemned prisoners, <lp> {this cart} and this cart is the tumbrel.
13:40
Dickens calls it the rude<emp> cart, which means humbly, humble or rustic<emp>, <sp> so {uh} just as {um} Fate
13:52
which acted as the woodsman in cutting down trees which will be used to make the guillotine<rt>,
13:58
here too rude carts are being readied which will be employed, utilized during the<rt> <sp> revolution.
14:07
But at this point of time, <sp> years before what is happening to the rude carts which is kind
14:13
of bespattered with mire, <sp> pigs come and sniff at it<rt>, poultry roosts within the carts<rt>, but
14:21
ultimately the cart will be used by farmer Death<ft>.
14:25
What is interesting again in this set of excerpts is the fact that Dickens picks the metaphors
14:33
from {um} the idea of farming, from the rural world.
14:38
Here, farmer <sp> becomes the agent of death.
14:42
Farmer who harvests, <sp> [you know,] grains, who harvest paddy using sickle becomes the agent
14:49
of death, and earlier Fate<rt> <sp> is compared to the woodsman<rt> who cuts down trees.
14:57
So all these metaphors are drawn from the <sp> humble, modest, {um} rural lifestyle. <lp>
15:09
And now once again, the narrator brings together two concepts which we were talking about.
15:14
“But that Woodman and that Farmer, though they work unceasingly<rt>, work silently, and
15:20
no one heard them as they went about with muffled tread: <sp> the rather, forasmuch as to
15:26
entertain any suspicion that they were awake, was to be atheistically and traitorous<ft>.”
15:31
So what is being discussed in this excerpt? <sp>
15:36
Dickens says that this figure Woodman who is cutting down trees<emp> in order to make the
15:42
guillotine<emp>, <lp> and this man farmer<emp> who is the personification of Death, who will lead the
15:52
prisoners in rude carts to the {uh} guillotine, are working <sp> {silently} silently, unceasingly is without
16:02
stopping<emp>, and nobody is able to hear them as they walk about with quiet footsteps muffled,
16:10
[you know,] muffled is you cannot hear them distinctly; tread, tread is walking. <sp>
16:17
[So they,] why are they walking in such a quiet manner?<rt>
16:21
It is because they do not want to arouse the suspicion of anybody who is, [you know,] trying
16:28
to listen to them<rt>.
16:29
So, they do not want to wake anybody<rt> to this idea that things are set in motion which will
16:34
bring a lot of <sp> change in society.
16:38
So even to be aware of all these things is to be atheistic {uh} and traitorous, you will be
16:45
treasonous to the society even if you kind of think<rt> that these things are set in motion,
16:51
even if you harbour a hope or belief or expectation that these things will happen in society,
16:57
that a thing called French Revolution can come into play.
17:00
So, {um} if you want to sum up the set of ideas that I have discussed so far<rt>, one is; <sp> things
17:09
are in extremes<ft> <sp>, life is understood <sp> in extremes because life is<emp> in extremes. <sp>
17:18
For example, there is a lot of, [you know,] divide<emp> between the rich <sp> and the poor, <lp> therefore {uh} 
17:31
things are understood in extremes<ft>.
17:33
Life is either full of hope or life is full of despair<ft> <sp> , that is what the<rt> first section <sp>
17:42
told us<ft> very symbolically, either life is full of light<rt> or life is full of darkness<ft>.
17:49
So that is the idea that is being conveyed<emp> in that very first important <sp> passage.
17:54
And the other point that {um} the narrator is trying to {uh} put forth here is that {uh} , [you know,] people
18:02
are not aware that things are set in motion which will bring about the French Revolution,
18:09
and all these things are <sp> happening metaphorically in the rural areas {um} because that is where there
18:16
is a lot of want<emp> and deprivation<ft>.
18:19
So there is a foreshadowing<emp> of <sp> things to come<ft>.
18:26
And Dickens draws these metaphors from the rural world. <lp>
18:34
And those examples are {clear} clearly given there, which is that of the Woodman and the Farmer,
18:38
who are preparing certain objects<emp>, who are preparing certain transportation<emp> which will
18:45
punishment to those who had committed sins against the peasants<ft>. <lp>
18:51
Now, let us look at chapter 2<emp> which is called <sp> The Mail<ft>.
18:57
The mail is the mail coach <lp> , so it is [a basically a carriage which will,] a horse-drawn carriage <sp>
19:11
which will transport people from one place to another.
19:14
So this is before the age of the railways<emp>, and we constantly need to remember that this
19:19
is late 18th century that we are <sp> in in this novel<ft>.
19:26
So we have an illustration here<emp> of a man stopping a mail coach, and this is the {uh} man who has
19:36
come with a particular {uh} message to one of the figures who is travelling by this mail coach.
19:43
And {um} the man offers a letter to the passenger<ft> that he<rt> is interested in<ft>. <lp>
19:49
So this scene happens one Friday night late in November<emp>, and this is the description which
20:01
talks about the state of affairs at that particular night in November. <sp>
20:07
Why have I put this except there on the slide for you?<rt>
20:11
It is because to give you an idea of the kind of atmosphere<emp> that was there in those days,
20:19
and particularly in that particular day<rt> in November and that atmosphere is also metaphoric<emp>,
20:26
because it talks about <sp> various shades<emp> of [you know], state of affairs that is happening in
20:33
the <sp> novel and which is also reflective of the society of that period<ft>
20:37
“There was a steaming<emp> mist in all the hollows<rt>, <sp> and it had roamed in its forlornness up the
20:45
hill, like an evil<emp> spirit seeking rest and finding none. <sp>
20:50
A clammy and intensely cold mist, it made its slow way through the air <sp> in ripples that
20:57
visibly followed and overspread one another, <sp> as the waves of an unwholesome sea might do<rt>. <sp>
21:04
It was dense enough to shut out everything from the light of the coach lamps<rt> <sp> but these
21:09
its own workings, and a few yards of road, and the reek<rt> of the labouring horses steamed
21:15
into it, as if they had made it all<ft>.” <lp>
21:19
Setting is pretty clear<rt>, {it's} it is late at night on a Friday in November, which means this
21:25
is winter<emp>. <lp>
21:28
And this is happening in {uh} a kind of a deserted {uh} space, there is no habitation, {uh} there is just
21:36
wild nature<ft>.
21:38
And at this point of time<rt>, there is mist everywhere, a steaming<rt> mist, [as if it's], as if the mist
21:46
is kind of roaming everywhere, here and there, the mist is roaming<emp>, it is circulating, and
21:52
the mist is kind of personified as an evil<emp> spirit.
21:56
Look at the phrase evil spirit, <sp> so the mist is compared to this<emp> spirit, and this spirit
22:03
is restless as if it is kind of trying to seek rest and it is not finding any<emp> kind of
22:10
rest, and it is clammy, it is wet to the touch, it is intensely cold<emp>.
22:16
And it is kind of making its way slowly<emp> through the air <sp> and it is making visible ripples.
22:23
So it is a very evocative passage, <lp> what is the meaning of evocative? 
22:30
It [kind of] brings a vivid picture on your mind.
22:34
And it is an unwholesome kind of <sp> mist too, it is not a very healthy mist, <sp> and it was
22:42
preventing visibility, it was dense enough to shut out everything from the light, <sp> [see,]
22:49
and again it reminds us of that first paragraph which begins the novel it was a season of
22:55
light and the same time it was the season of darkness.
22:57
So even though there is light <sp> from the coach lamps<rt>, that light is being shut out by the<rt>
23:04
mist, by this fog. <sp>
23:08
And even the horses are steaming, adding<emp> to this mist through their {uh} steamy breath<ft>.
23:16
So {it's a} it is a very<rt>, very vivid picture that {uh} Dickens is painting through his <sp> third person narrator,
23:24
and it tells us {um} of a day, <sp> or precisely the night in November, and it tells us metaphorically
23:33
that <sp> we are not able to clearly see what is happening around us.
23:38
[So], this invisibility<emp> <lp> is <sp> symbolic of the lack of penetration that one {um} suffers from in those
23:51
periods; it was difficult for someone to understand the workings of society at that period. <lp>
23:57
[So,] {uh} let us continue with this {um} section on the mail, and <sp> this except that is there on the
24:07
slide tells us about the<rt> <sp> thoughts of the <sp> passengers who are inside the carriage<ft>, inside the mail
24:17
coach.
24:18
And the narrator says that, “Not one of these<rt> could have said, from anything he saw<rt>,
24:23
what either of the two was like<rt>; and each was hidden under almost as many wrappers from
24:28
the eyes of the mind, <sp> as from the eyes of the body of his two companions.” <sp>
24:34
So the narrator is philosophically pointing out that {um} nobody inside the carriage was able
24:43
to understand what the other person was like<rt>, as well as understand what was going on in {um}
24:50
that person's mind, because they were all wrapped up, and they were all covered, because
24:56
remember, it is a November night, it is the height of winter<emp>, it is very, very cold<emp>, so
25:00
everybody is nicely wrapped up with lots of clothes<emp>.
