1. **Disfluencies also usually mark clause/semantic boundaries.**


2. **Either "some kind of" is a construction, or pauses appear before content words, NPs, etc.
 [[ Generally in PPs, prepositions are analysed as part of the NP inside PP, but here we see that the pauses usually happen after the preposition if they do.]]**

a) ``actually some kind of {uh} potential<rt>``

**Possible issues: Manual annotations are biased, expectations of pauses, and listening to clauses we might ignore pauses. Will help to analyse automatic pause annotations,**
